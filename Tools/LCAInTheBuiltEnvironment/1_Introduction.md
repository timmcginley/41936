# 1 Introduction

This page provides a practical summary of building Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), focusing on current Danish legislation (prior to July 1st, 2025), upcoming climate legislation (effective after July 1st, 2025), available LCA tools, and the integration of circular economy principles in LCA practices. LCA serves as a collaborative tool, enabling teams to assess the environmental impact of buildings across various phases, from material production to demolition. As regulations evolve and climate targets tighten, understanding the interplay between legislation and LCA is crucial for optimizing sustainability in the built environment. Additionally, applying circular economy strategies within the LCA framework can help drive significant reductions in resource consumption and carbon emissions.
