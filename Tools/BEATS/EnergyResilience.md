# B2: Energy peak loads

The building cannot be viewed as a stand-alone unit, it integrates with thermal and electrical networks. To be grid-supportive, it is crucial to focus on peak loads and potentially to flatten those peaks. The beat should document whole-building peak heat load and peak cooling load [kW/m2].
