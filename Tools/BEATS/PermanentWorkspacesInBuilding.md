# F1: # of permanent workspaces in building

This value is important for the client in making a business case for renting the building â€“ and for you to design the building. At least 90% of the permanent workspaces should meet the minimum daylight requirements in the Danish Building Code. A lot of design choices depend on the number of persons in the building; fire measures (evacuation time, width of stairs), canteen size, number of toilets, size of ventilation etc.

**Your project should provide the number of permanant desks you have promised in your KPI. _Be careful to make sure you calculate by actually drawing the desks in each office_ - accurate understanding of this number is essential to understand your progress. The idea here is to enable you to be able to provide a specific amount of function in the building rather than just 'max out the site'.**

*In addition you should have 300 student workspaces. This value is a measure of the flexibility for the building in taking in students. This should be in a well-designed area with focus on acoustics, group work etc. There are no formal daylight requirements for the student, except that the entire area must have access to daylight.*
