The purpose of the beats is to help us to understand the implications of the decisions you are making. Also it should help you to see that it is not possible to optimise every requirement. There are 12 beats for you to monitor, 3 in each of the 4 parts of the course.

## Retired in 2024

### Building Volume 
What is the volume of your building? We like this value because it means you have at least calculated the footprint and height and if you have complex shape(s) maybe you have calculated it more accurately? 

### Footprint area 
What is the footprint area of your building, are you using all the available space or leaving some for green space for instance? 

### # of floors above ground 
We want you to consider the number of floors in the building. This is both to think about how you can increase the amount of rentable space in the building, but also so that we can be clear how you are addressing issues such as floor to floor height, for instance. 

### # of floors below ground 
How many floors do you have below ground? 

### F2F Ground floor 
This may be different from the other floors. 
### # of car park spaces 

### # of permanent workspaces in student areas
