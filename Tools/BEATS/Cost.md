# Cost

This is the total (estimated cost of the project). See PM subject for what is included and what is omitted.

The cost should clearly demonstrate the savings from choosing renovation over a new building. 
So renovating a building of XX m2 at 8,000 DKK/m2, compared to an original budget of 40,000 DKK/m2. For example: for a 2,000 m2 building, the savings would be 64,000,000â€‰DKK. The savings equation is (KPI/m2-COST/m2)* XX m2
