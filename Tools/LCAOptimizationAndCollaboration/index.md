This page is part of the teaching material for the DTU course 41936: Advanced Building Design. It emphasizes the essential role of interdisciplinary collaboration and project optimization in reducing the environmental impact of building projects.
Specifically, the page examines how each major discipline on a project team contributes to a more sustainable project design from the earliest conceptual phase (Phase A) through to the final tender design stage (Phase D). The disciplines considered include:

•	[Architecture and Fire Safety (ARCH)](3_ArchitectAndFire.md)

•	[Geotechnical Engineering (GEO)](4_Geotech.md)

•	[Materials and Life Cycle Assessment (MAT)](2_Material.md)

•	[Structural Engineering (STR)](5_Structural.md)

•	[Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing systems engineer (MEP)](6_MEP.md)

•	[Project Management (PM)](7_ProjectManagers)

Through this interdisciplinary lens, the section demonstrates the value of advanced building design in ensuring a holistic approach to sustainability, ultimately reducing the environmental impact as reflected in the project’s LCA results.
