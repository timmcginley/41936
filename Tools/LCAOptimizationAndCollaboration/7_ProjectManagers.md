# 7 Project Managers (PM)
The PM team plays a central role in optimizing a project’s LCA through close collaboration with the other disciplines. By integrating LCA considerations early in the project and maintaining strong communication throughout, the PM team can guide decisions that reduce the environmental impact while ensuring that the project’s KPIs are met.

A key aspect of the PM team is aligning sustainability efforts with economic goals. PMs can drive LCA optimization by making sustainability a core aspect of decision-making, PMs can drive LCA optimization by incorporating sustainability into decision-making, particularly in the areas covered in [1 General LCA Prioritization](https://github.com/timmcginley/41936/blob/031bc41241928f88ad56a42a92e604c7c1a8dcb7/Tools/LCAOptimizationAndCollaboration/1_GeneralLCAPrioritization.md). The use of variant studies and careful EPD selection allows the team to estimate the emissions of their design while ensuring that decisions remain cost-effective. While LCC / cost estimation is not covered in this tool, early integration of these considerations enables PMs to make informed choices regarding building design, and material usage and product choice, optimizing both environmental performance and budget. By maintaining a focus on this optimization throughout the project, it becomes easier to track progress and ensure sustainability goals stay on course.

Collaboration between disciplines is crucial for achieving an optimal LCA result. Each role contributes differently as summarized:

•	STR designs the structural system and must reduce its environmental impact by minimizing material quantities or adopting alternative low-carbon systems.

•	ARCH directly influences embodied carbon, energy demand, and fire safety through design choices. They must evaluate design variations that reduce environmental impact and justify any solutions that cannot be changed.

•	MEP must design efficient energy systems, ideally select low-impact installations, and provide MAT with key figures for operational energy use from the BE report. 

•	MAT guides the other subject teams and performs all necessary LCA calculations.

•	GEO designs the foundations and must reduce its climate impact by exploring different options that minimize material quantities low-carbon alternatives. 

While each discipline has its specific focus, the PM’s role is to facilitate communication, ensuring all efforts are aligned and sustainability is integrated without causing delays or exceeding the budget. The PM ensures that LCA optimization is both practical and achievable, aligning sustainability with financial responsibility and contributing to the project’s overall success.
