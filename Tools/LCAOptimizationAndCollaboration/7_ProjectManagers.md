# 7 Project Managers (PM)
The PM team plays a central role in optimizing a project’s LCA through close collaboration with the other disciplines. By integrating LCA considerations early in the project and maintaining strong communication throughout, the PM team can guide decisions that reduce the environmental impact while ensuring that the project’s KPIs are met.

A key aspect of the PM team is aligning sustainability efforts with economic goals. PMs can drive LCA optimization by making sustainability a core aspect of decision-making, PMs can drive LCA optimization by incorporating sustainability into decision-making, particularly in the areas covered in 4.1 General LCA prioritization . The use of variant studies and careful EPD selection allows the team to estimate the emissions of their design while ensuring that decisions remain cost-effective. While LCC / cost estimation is not covered in this tool, early integration of these considerations enables PMs to make informed choices regarding building design, and material usage and product choice, optimizing both environmental performance and budget. By maintaining a focus on this optimization throughout the project, it becomes easier to track progress and ensure sustainability goals stay on course.
