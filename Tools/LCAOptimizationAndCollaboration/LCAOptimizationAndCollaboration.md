# LCAOptimizationAndCollaboration

## General LCA Prioritization
Early incorporation of environmental impact reduction strategies is vital. Decisions made during the concept phase often determine the bulk of a project’s environmental footprint. Fixed decisions made during the concept phase, such as the building’s form, structural system, layout, or material choices, can 'lock in' a project's resource consumption and emissions early on, leaving limited opportunities for significant sustainability improvements later in the design process.
A successful project is not merely the sum of each discipline’s individual contributions, it requires integrated, transdisciplinary collaboration and data-driven decision-making from the earliest design phases through the final tender. If the LCA is treated as an afterthought, aligning the project with meaningful environmental goals or KPIs becomes highly unlikely – same goes for other initiatives.
