# 3 Architect and Fire (ARCH)
Architects and Fire Engineers play a crucial role in shaping a building’s environmental footprint. The choices made by ARCH regarding geometry, materials, and fire safety solutions directly impact the building’s embodied carbon and energy demand.
One of the most effective ways ARCH can improve an LCA through close collaboration with MAT to integrate low-emission materials into their design from the outset. Rather than designing the building first and selecting materials afterwards, consider working with MAT in material comparison to identify low-emission material options and make it a part of the design. Figure 3.1 and 3.2 shows a simple material comparison using generic environmental values for different floor types, with associated emissions pr. m2 flooring. The comparison reveals that wood and linoleum floors perform the best. Unless other project criteria or DGNB requirements specify otherwise, one of these options would be ideal for improving the LCA outcome.

Another effective way to improve the LCA result is by collaborating with STR early in the concept and design process to identify solutions that minimize material usage and explore low-emission material options. For example, variant studies could be conducted to evaluate structural systems using CLT, low-emission concrete, or hybrid wood-concrete.

In addition, optimizing the building’s geometry is a key strategy. Thoughtful geometry not only reduces material use but also enhances structural efficiency and minimizes fireproofing needs. One of the most effective strategies for ARCH is designing a compact building form with a high floor-to-facade ratio, which reduces emissions per square meter. By collaborating with STR, ARCH can refine the building’s shape to minimize the number and size of load-bearing elements, thus reducing the need for high-carbon materials like concrete and steel. Careful planning of fire compartments and escape routes can further reduce the need for additional fireproofing measures, further minimizing environmental impact. 

It is important for ARCH to frequently update PM on design decisions and provide insights into areas of concern and different options regarding building geometry and material choice. This enables PM to monitor the design decisions and assess their impact on the budget (e.g. via cost estimation. This allows PM to intervene when necessary or direct relevant subject teams to consult with ARCH.
