# 5 Structural (STR)
Since the load bearing systems of the building often contribute a lot to the climate impact, it is especially important that STR and MAT communicate a lot during the design process. Since different materials have different load bearing capabilities, MAT must be ready to help STR calculate the difference in climate impact between multiple solutions, or at the very least provide them with the necessary knowledge to make the calculations themselves.

The climate impact of the structural system should be a constant consideration from the beginning of the project to avoid locking the project into a high impact solution, as changes to the structural system are much easier to implement early in the design process. This means that MAT must be ready to help STR calculate the difference in climate impact between multiple solutions, or at the very least provide them with the necessary knowledge to make the calculations themselves. Additionally, STR must also collaborate with ARCH, as the building design directly influences the structural system in terms of type of system and material quantities needed. Different solutions should be evaluated through variant studies. See Material Selection in LINK for specific example.
