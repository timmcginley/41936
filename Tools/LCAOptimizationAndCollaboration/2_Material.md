# Material (MAT)
The MAT team is responsible for performing all necessary LCA calculations and guiding the project in a more sustainable direction. This, in essence, means that the MAT team has two primary responsibilities being:

1)	Ensuring that other subject teams understand the information required for LCA calculations.
  
2)	Collaborating with and providing guidance to other subject teams to make decisions that reduce the project's climate impact.

In the later stages of the project, if EPDs are considered, MAT must work with the relevant subject teams to verify that the products covered by the EPDs meet the project’s specific requirements.

By closely collaborating with ARCH from the beginning of the design process, it becomes possible to integrate low-emission materials into the design from the start. Instead of letting ARCH design the building first and selecting materials afterward, consider working with ARCH from the start to identify low-emission options and shape the design around them.

Since the load bearing systems of the building often contribute a lot to the climate impact, it is especially important to assist STR in their decision making. Since different materials have different load bearing capabilities, MAT must be ready to help STR calculate the difference in climate impact between multiple solutions, or at the very least provide them with the necessary knowledge to make the calculations themselves. The same applies in collaboration with GEO, though, their options will often be more limited.

The importance and effort required in collaboration with MEP may vary depending on whether the group decides to model the technical installations in their LCA calculations or use default values. When using default values, the collaboration with MEP will mostly deal with operational energy use. This, for example, means comparing whether using more insulation materials to reduce heating requirements results in a net reduction in climate impact, which requires calculations to be made by both teams. If solar panels are necessary to meet energy efficiency requirements, MAT must assist MEP in choosing the correct panels, as solar panels can have dire consequences for a building’s climate impact. Should the group decide to model the technical installations, MAT needs to clearly communicate to MEP, which quantities are necessary according to BR18 Appendix 2, table 6. Depending on the complexity of the project, this may require a lot of effort.

It is important for MAT to frequently update PM on the climate impact of the project as well as providing knowledge about causes of concern regarding LCA calculations. This allows PM to keep an eye on decisions made by other subjects that might increase climate impact and either prevent them or let the relevant subject team know to discuss with MAT first.
