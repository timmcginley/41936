# DGNB-lite: 41936 Advanced Building Design 2024 - DTU Construct

## What is DGNB and DGNB-lite?
*DGNB is a certification system regarding sustainable building produced by German Sustainable Building Council (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen). It translates various factors that dictate sustainable planning and construction into practical application.*

*The conceptual principles of DGNB revolve around a holistic understanding of sustainability, encompassing not only the environmental(ENV) impact that is usually quoted when referring to sustainability, but also other aspects such as socialcultural(SOC), economic(ECO), technical(TEC), project(PRO) and site (SITE). While SOC, ENV and ECO are weighted equally, sharing 22,5% each in the total points, TEC, PRO and SITE shares 15%, 12,5% and 5% respectively.*

*In this DGNB-lite version custom-made for 41936, the DGNB System Version 2020 International is referred with slight adjustment regarding LCA requirement to fit with the Danish Building Regulation.The practice of DGNB-lite in the course is intended to give students an understanding of how the DGNB certification system works with the design process in reality and gives students the possibility to carry out the auditing work.*


## DGNB-lite scoring and levels
The points in DGNB-lite might not follow the actual DGNB document, for example some focuses are weighted higher because of how we fit them with the learning objectives and the whole SITE topic is excluded according to the course scope. But the concept to obtain a certified level is still the same:

Platinum: Scoring an overall 80% with each topic scoring at least 65%

Gold: Scoring an overall 65% with each topic scoring at least 50%

Si* Lver: Scoring an overall 50% with each topic scoring at least 35%

The maximum possible point of DGNB-lite is 2200, which gives 1760, 1430, 1100 and 770 the threshold points respectively for each level. Students can arrange freely which DGNB criteria you acquire the points from. A final audit will be carried out on Week-13 to validate your claim and decide your DGNB-lite level.

Grading instruction
If there is Levels in DGNB criteria, you can get the point of the highest level you achieve. If there is a ‘+’ sign in the possible point, you can get accumulated points when you achieve more than one criteria. Otherwise, everything in the criteria has to be completed in order to get the point for that criteria.

Documentation and references
Documentation: All documentation provided should be clearly defined and labelled in reference to the criteria and the level that you wish to optain points at.

Ensure to provide references for all your arguments and documentation. This also includes digital tools and models used as part of the documentation of a criterion, incl. materials provided by other subjects.

All models, diagrams, figures and drawings should be clearly labelled, with clear signature explanation of illustrations and what they convey. All visual element should be of quality, meaning that text and figures are easily discerned. If in doubt, please include a full-size version as part of the appendix as well.
