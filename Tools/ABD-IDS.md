# IDS OpenBIM Model Checking
We produce BIM models because we want to use the data they contain. We produce OpenBIM models because we don't want anyone to be able to restrict our access to our models now or in the future.

The Advanced Building Design Lab / <a href="https://timmcginley.github.io/Circular-Education-System/" target="_blank">here</a> (new tab) concept encourages the reuse of previous designs inorder to learn from them and improve on them to create better, more sustainable buildings.

We therefore need to mkae sure that our OpenBIM models contain the information that we need them to.

Advanced Building Design uses the IDS concept.
