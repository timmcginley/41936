# Design Grid
>Designing better, more sustainable buildings requires interdisciplinary analysis throughout the design process.

## Building Design Challenges

* In the early design stages (when it is easiest to make changes) consultants do not have all the design information they need to do their analysis.
* Single disciplines can only see their own requirements, models, building systems, work practices and knowledge and may not be able to empathise with other disciplines, reducing the chance of effective compromise.
* Modelling the building in seperate building models and drawings cna make it difficult to get an 'overview' of the building.

## A new design and analysis framework
To address these challenges we propose a lightweight framework called the 'Design Grid' to help simplify the design and analysis of buildings. Designs progress from top to bottom and left to right. The grid does not differentiate between disciplines but instead focuses on 16 conceptual elements of the building. It does not explicitly define the relationship between the concepts instead it prompts the design team to discuss and identify these themselves.

The Design Grid has the following properties:

### 1. Provide simple overview (Rows)
Buildings are complex, but this can be simplified by dividing the elements into functional, horizontal, bounding or vertical elements, this is how we have designed the rows.

### 2. Encourage disciplinary empathy (Connections between boxes)
Enable members of the design team to quickly see the implications of each other decisions. Furthermore the framework reduces the complicating factor of 'disciplinary ownership of systems' which increases the potential for conflict and reduces opportunites to achieve effective compromise.

### 3. Enable exploration of iternatives
In order to design better, more sustainable buildings we need to develop and analyse different ideas, the DesignGrid enablesus to see the implications of different options and the effect they have on other elements.

### 4. Define and monitor goals
The last row includes both the materialised solutions for the building and the use of the building, so that you can check your design against the original need of the building (its use).
