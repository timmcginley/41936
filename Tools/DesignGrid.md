# Design Grid
>Designing better, more sustainable buildings requires interdisciplinary analysis throughout the design process.

This is traditionally problematic because:

* In the early design stages (when it is easiest to make changes) consultants do not have all the design information they need to do their analysis.
* Single disciplines can only see their own requirements, models, building systems, work practices and knowledge and may not be able to empathise with other disciplines, reducing the chance of effective compromise.
* 

To address these challenges we propose a lightweight framework we call the 'Design Grid' to help simplify the design and analysis of buildings into 16 elements.
