This course has been designed to give participants a professional interdisciplinary design experience. This requires a slight shift in naming.
> Students = Consultants<br>
> Teachers = Chief Consultants


## Consultants
After dividing into [subject interests](../Subjects) in week 1, you will be invited to form small consultancies. More information on this can be found [here](Companies)


## Cheif Consultants
The role formally known as teachers will now be called 'Cheif consultants'.

We need to learn to support each other to design the best buildings in the world. To do this you will form disciplinary specific [companies](Company.md) that provide engineering and or design consulatancy services as part of a [team](Team.md) for the [client](Client.md).

> You should have **expertise / experience / enthusiasm** for the role you choose *and* **empathy** for all the other roles.
