This course has been designed to give participants a professional interdisciplinary design experience. This requires a slight shift in naming.
> Students = Consultants<br>
> Teachers = Chief Consultants


## Consultants
After dividing into [subject interests](../Subjects) in week 1, you will be invited to form small consultancies. More information on this can be found [here](Companies)


## Chief Consultants
The role formally known as teachers will now be called 'Cheif consultants'.
