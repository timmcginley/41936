# Interdisciplinary Architecture
## Architecture -> Structure
The relationship between structures and architecture is very important and
needs to be strong. You can use this to explore ideas about what each subject
should model. For instance, one approach for the floors is for the architects
to model the finished floor and for the structures group to model the
structural slab. This should avoid potential clashes in the federated BIM
(model/s).
## Architecture -> MEP
The relationship to building services is really important to architecture,
for instance, the location of the plant rooms and the routes of larger
ventilation ducting that may be too noisy for space requirements such as
meeting rooms.
## Architecture -> PM / ICT
The integration to the ICT/PM group is really important. A symbiotic
relationship between the two subjects can help improve the quality,
communication and frequency of early design decisions.
