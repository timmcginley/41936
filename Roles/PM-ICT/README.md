**The project manager must ensure that the deliverables are created and submitted on time. Different strategies can be used to reach this goal. The project manager can direct team members to work in a specific way or leave the room and allow the participants to develop and implement a strategy to meet the goals.**

According to “Description of Services for Building and Landscape 2018”: 2.2 ICT management | In respect of agreed digital design work, the ICT manager is responsible for coordinating any digital cooperation between the consultants, design contractors, the client and any authorities together with the design manager. The digital design cooperation is organized based on the ICT specification of the consultancy agreement. If no ICT specification has been prepared, the ICT manager will organize the digital cooperation together with the consultants.

## PM/ICT Requirements 

## On budget
The proposed scheme must be within the budgetary framework including all parts of the building + operational cost + design cost.

## On time
The proposed scheme must be within the time frame.

## Sustainable
The proposed scheme must meet the target DGNB class.

## Well managed
The design project must be well managed.

## Promote BIM and digital tools
Teams should make use of digital tools and create a BIM Building Information Model.

# PM/ICT Integration

## PM/ICT -> Architecture
The integration between the ICT/PM and architecture group is really important. A symbiotic
relationship between the two subjects can help improve the quality, communication and timely design decisions. Both subjects have shared role in space planning - Architecture with the visible and ICT/PM with the hidden spaces in the building.

* Create the BIM Model template together with the Architect and share it for the entire team to use the same for all subject models
* Continuously exchange BIM models
* Coordinate waste management system applied in the building

## PM/ICT -> Structures
* Spatial coordination and choice of structural system
* Location of stiffening system
* Stimulate coordination with Architecture,MEP, Geotech, and Fire
* Stimulate sustainable considerations
* Continuously exchange BIM models
* Quantities

## PM/ICT -> MEP
* Spatial coordination
* Location of shafts
* Routing of pipes and ducts
* Stimulate coordination with Architecture and Structures
* Stimulate sustainable considerations
* Continuously exchange BIM models
* Quantities

## PM/ICT -> Geotech
* Location and size of excavation
* Spatial coordination of foundations
* Stimulate coordination with Structural
* Stimulate sustainable considerations
* Continuously exchange BIM models
* Quantities

## PM/ICT -> Fire
* Location and size of stair and lifts for firefighters
* Spatial coordination of egress routes
* Stimulate coordination with Architecture, Structural, and MEP
* Stimulate sustainable considerations
* Continuously exchange BIM models
* Quantities for passive and active fire protection systems
* Maintenance and operation costs for fire protections systems

## PM/ICT -> Materials
* Assist “Materials” in quantity take-off
* Continuously make access to Quantities/BIM models
* Classification/types of materials
