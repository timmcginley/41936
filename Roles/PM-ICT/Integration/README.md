# Interdisciplinary PM/ICT

## PM/ICT -> Architecture
The integration between the ICT/PM and architecture group is really important. A symbiotic relationship between the two subjects can help improve the quality, communication and timely design decisions. Both subjects have shared role in space planning - Architecture with the visible and ICT/PM with the hidden spaces in the building.
- Create the BIM Model template together with the Architect and share it for the entire team to use the same for all subject models
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Coordinate waste management system applied in the building

## PM/ICT -> Structures
- Spatial coordination and choice of structural system
- Location of stiffening system
- Stimulate coordination with Architecture,MEP, Geotech, and Fire
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities

## PM/ICT -> MEP
- Spatial coordination
- Location of shafts
- Routing of pipes and ducts
- Stimulate coordination with Architecture and Structures
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities
