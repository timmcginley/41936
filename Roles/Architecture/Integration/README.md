9# Interdisciplinary Architecture
## Architecture -> Structure
The relationship between structures and architecture is very important and
needs to be strong. You can use this to explore ideas about what each subject
should model. For instance, one approach for the floors is for the architects
to model the finished floor and for the structures group to model the
structural slab. This should avoid potential clashes in the federated BIM
(model/s).
## Architecture -> MEP
The relationship to building services is really important to architecture,
for instance, the location of the plant rooms and the routes of larger
ventilation ducting that may be too noisy for space requirements such as
meeting rooms.
## Architecture -> Geotech
The relationship to Geotech is important, for instance in the integration of
car parking but also in the coordination of columns in the building.
## Architecture -> Fire
The relationship to fire is really important, for details please view the fire
subject and check out its section on integration to Architecture.
## Architecture -> PM / ICT
The integration to the ICT/PM group is really important. A symbiotic
relationship between the two subjects can help improve the quality,
communication and frequency of early design decisions.
## Architecture -> Sustainability / Materials
Work closely to develop and [assess material options](https://www.archdaily.com/1004165/step-by-step-how-to-specify-materials-in-an-architecture-project) for the main elements of the building. Architecture needs to support the sustainability groups with the information they need.
