# ARCH Assignments
## Part A
Identify the parts of the project and the associated deadlines and
collaborative requirements for the structures group for the 13 and 3 week
period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be coordinated by
your PM group.
## Part B
### 7 week Subject Drawings
This should include the following drawing:
- (1) Section,
- (2) 3D view,
- (3) Ground floor plan,
- (4) Office plan.

These should describe the different elements in the design including those
from the other subjects, e.g. space for installations ducts vertically and
horizontally, daylight on working places, number and sizes of elevators, room
demands for toilets, tea kitchens and other secondary rooms.
## Part C 
### Subject Report
The Part C subject report for architecture will be organised in the themes /
elements of the project, furthermore, it will clearly explain the different
available options and discuss the decision process and trade offs. Examples
of how the Team KPIs and project beats have been used to inform the deign are
also important. This is your main opportunity for written formative (in
progress feedback from both your teacher and peers, so make the best of it ðŸ˜Š 
### BIM
Facade, entrance, ground floor and reception area with furniture and all the

building, stair access to the building roof, faÃ§ade cleaning system crane.
## Part D 
### Subject Report
This is a continuation on the 13 week report but with more detail on the
themes discussed in the course. This report describes the work done to develop
a preliminary design (LO9).
- collaborate with the other specialists (LO1)
- integrate the different requirements into your architectural design (LO5)
- explore alternatives (LO6)
- justify and defend your design decisions (LO8)
