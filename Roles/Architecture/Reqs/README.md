# Architecture Requirements

Advanced Building Design requires the collaborative design, modelling, analysis, communication and iteration of interdisciplinary solutions to each building system at every stage of the design process. specifically this means the responsibilities and dependencies for architecture are:

## Client Requirements
* Synthesise the client requirements into aesthetic and functional SPACES.

## Design Concept
* Develop, synthesis and communicate the architectural design concept(s) to the satisfaction of the design team and the client.

## BR18
* Check BR18 conformance.

## Iterate
* Model different design options for FACADE, BUILDING ENVELOPE, AUDITORIUM and others,to guide and facilitate analysis and feedback from the team.

## Spatial Relationships
* Define the relationships between the SPACES required by the client.

## Building Mass
* Define and iterate the mass (form) of the building envelope.

## Circulation and Accessability
* Define access to and egress from the BUILDING

## Acoustic Analysis of the spaces
* Perform acoustic analysis of the SPACES.

## Facade Design
* Design and iterate the FACADE based on the space requirements and input from MEP from concept through to detail design.

## An integrated building design
* it should be a welcoming and inclusive building
* why would people go to the building - how does it seem interesting / inviting?
* Is it a landmark building and to what extent does it try and blend into the
surroundings? How do we know it is a DTU building but also something new? What
statement is it making?
* Consider the different elements of the building and how they are combined to
support the subject and project requirements.

## Architectural Concept
Clear concept for the building - what is it the architecture is trying to
achieve- does you building effect how people feel? if so how and is this what
you intended? One definition is that architecture either supports truth or
narrative: if truth it should focus on expressing its real purpose, if
narrative it should tell you a story that inspires you to think in a certain
way.

## Design Process
get this back from the manual!!!

## Strategies and tactics
As Architects with an engineer’s curiosity to test, you should separate your
strategies (your idea) for your tactics (the realisation of the idea), so you
know which to change as you iterate. These should be testable against the
client and technical requirements where possible (learning Objective 5.
Integrate various technical requirements into a functional building design
that satisfies the client brief.)

## Keep it simple
Both the architectural ideas and your presentation of them should be expressed
simply, always.

## Building Envelope
The architectural mass, sometimes called the form (or more simply the shape) should be considered and explored early in iterations, decisions on this effect all disciplines. You should consider both the architectural and engineering mass of the building.

## Circulation
Design, analyse and communicate how to navigate the building considering:
* how to enter the building from outside (pedestrian, bicycle and car),
from the parking area.
* Universal Design principles.
* Circulation through the building, how is this communicated to the users?
How do people move around and between floors, how do they know where to
go?
* The design should embrace the principles of Universal Design. It is
important to explore how to achieve maximum usability through the design
of spaces, use of light and choice of materials.

## Spaces
* Spatial hierarchy: Consider the hierarchy of the spaces including size of corridors, lobbies,informal and formal meeting and working spaces. Consider the spaces required
to support the ‘hero’ spaces of the building.
* Use of public spaces / consider separation of public and private spaces.

## Facade
Design the facade considering:
- How it signifies the function of the building,
- The materials, texture and design,
- Windows on other openings
- Wall construction with vapour barrier, insulation, secondary
construction, wind barrier and cladding
- the sun shading system
- the rhythm that that it creates on the elevation
- the window cleaning system etc.

## Structure
Consider the integration of all the architectural elements with the structure.
Columns can organize space - use them.

## Open design process


## Try it!
Embrace both the in and out of control elements of the process. If in doubt -
start and try it, and then try it again ����

## Think abstract
Where possible think in abstractions - its faster ���� Try and sketch out ideas
to explore the implications.
