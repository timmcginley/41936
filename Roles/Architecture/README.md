# Architecture
The Architecture sibject s responsible for the management of the
usable spaces and the facade and the overall composition of the
building. The subject group needs to get their heads into the project
quickly and start exploring the potential form (shape) and
arrangement of the building to support the investigations of the
other subjects. If this initial work is done well, it will provide
you with a valuable perspective on the building design process. An
example task will be to coordinate the shape of the floor plate with
required rooms and the structural modules. Whilst you will have ideas
for the building you will find that your time will also need to be
spent coming up with good design solutions between the needs of the
different members of the team.

## Responsibilities
Advanced building design requires team collaboration between different roles. It is therefore important to establish the responsibilities and dependencies of each role. For arhcitecture these are:
* Synthesing the client requirements into aesthetic and functional spaces.
* Developing, synthesising and communicating the architectural design concept(s).
* Model different design options for FACADE, BUILDING ENVELOPE, AUDITORIUM and others,to guide and facilitate analysis and feedback from the team.
* Define the relationships between the SPACES required by the client.
* Define and iterate the mass (form) of the building envelope.
* Defining access and egress to the BUILDING
* Design of the car parking in the BASEMENT.
* Perform acoustic analysis of the SPACES.
* Design and iterate the FACADE based on the space requirements and input from MEP from concept through to detail design.
