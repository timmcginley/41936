# Architecture
The Architecture needs to develop interdisciplinary design solutions from the initial design (PART A) through to the detail design (PART D).

## Responsibilities
Advanced building design requires team collaboration between different roles. It is therefore important to establish the responsibilities and dependencies of each role. For architecture these are:
* Synthesing the client requirements into aesthetic and functional spaces.
* Developing, synthesising and communicating the architectural design concept(s).
* Model different design options for FACADE, BUILDING ENVELOPE, AUDITORIUM and others,to guide and facilitate analysis and feedback from the team.
* Define the relationships between the SPACES required by the client.
* Define and iterate the mass (form) of the building envelope.
* Defining access and egress to the BUILDING
* Design of the car parking in the BASEMENT.
* Perform acoustic analysis of the SPACES.
* Design and iterate the FACADE based on the space requirements and input from MEP from concept through to detail design.
