# Architecture

Advanced Building Design requires the collaborative design, modelling, analysis, communication and iteration of interdisciplinary solutions to each building system at every stage of the design process. specifically this means the responsibilities and dependencies for architecture are:
* Synthesise the client requirements into aesthetic and functional SPACES.
* Develop, synthesis and communicate the architectural design concept(s) to the satisfaction of the design team and the client.
* Check BR18 conformance.
* Model different design options for FACADE, BUILDING ENVELOPE, AUDITORIUM and others,to guide and facilitate analysis and feedback from the team.
* Define the relationships between the SPACES required by the client.
* Define and iterate the mass (form) of the building envelope.
* Define access to and egress from the BUILDING
* Design the car parking layout in the BASEMENT.
* Perform acoustic analysis of the SPACES.
* Design and iterate the FACADE based on the space requirements and input from MEP from concept through to detail design.
