# Architecture
The Architecture subject to 'hit the ground running' in the project and quickly synthesise the client requirements and start exploring the potential form (shape) and arrangement of the building to support the investigations of the other subjects. If this initial work is done well, it will provide you with a valuable perspective on the building design process. The role needs find to develop interdisciplinary design solutions, incorporating the differing needs of the design team.

## Responsibilities
Advanced building design requires team collaboration between different roles. It is therefore important to establish the responsibilities and dependencies of each role. For architecture these are:
* Synthesing the client requirements into aesthetic and functional spaces.
* Developing, synthesising and communicating the architectural design concept(s).
* Model different design options for FACADE, BUILDING ENVELOPE, AUDITORIUM and others,to guide and facilitate analysis and feedback from the team.
* Define the relationships between the SPACES required by the client.
* Define and iterate the mass (form) of the building envelope.
* Defining access and egress to the BUILDING
* Design of the car parking in the BASEMENT.
* Perform acoustic analysis of the SPACES.
* Design and iterate the FACADE based on the space requirements and input from MEP from concept through to detail design.
