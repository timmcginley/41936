# Architecture

Advanced Building Design requires team collaboration between different roles. It requires the collaborative development of interdisciplinary design solutions from the initial design (PART A) through to the detail design (PART D). Specifically, the responsibilities and dependencies for architecture are:
* Synthesing the client requirements into aesthetic and functional spaces.
* Developing, synthesising and communicating the architectural design concept(s).
* Model different design options for FACADE, BUILDING ENVELOPE, AUDITORIUM and others,to guide and facilitate analysis and feedback from the team.
* Define the relationships between the SPACES required by the client.
* Define and iterate the mass (form) of the building envelope.
* Defining access and egress to the BUILDING
* Design of the car parking in the BASEMENT.
* Perform acoustic analysis of the SPACES.
* Design and iterate the FACADE based on the space requirements and input from MEP from concept through to detail design.
