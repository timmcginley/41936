# Structures Requirements

Besides the below, there will be more specific Structural Requirements included in one of the first teaching sessions.
Building concept

## Development of building concept, including:
- Choice of static system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates).
- Choice of material (concrete, steel, composite, etc).
- Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, wind loads).

# Structural quality
The structural quality should ensure lifetimes of 50-100 years for all essential building elements used in the building structure, facades, windows, etc.

# Refined Design
Refinement of preliminary design, only detailing (beams, columns, slabs, core) with respect to ventilation, floor area arrangement (individual offices, open plan office landscape, aisles, recreation areas), and fa√ßade connection to main structure.

# Load Combinations
Partial safety factors for different combinations and decisive load cases for overall and local structural design.

# Structural Members
Detail Design of structural members.

# Dynamic Properties
Establish dynamic properties.

# Building Motion
Assessment of building motion at top floors due to wind loading.

# Buildability
Easily buildable solutions are preferred. The construction period should be as short as possible.

# Promote maintenance friendly solutions
Robust and maintenance-friendly solutions should be used throughout the building.

# Facade
Concept design of the connection between the primary load carrying system and the secondary facade load carrying system.
