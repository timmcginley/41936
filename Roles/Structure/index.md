*The main role of structural engineers within civil engineering is the design of structures such as buildings, bridges and industrial facilities. In an ideal case structural engineers develop the initial design in partnership with architects.*

Today, the use of mathematical and numerical models of the structure to calculate the stresses that could arise from different load scenarios is common practice. In connection with the design of high-rise buildings the structural engineer needs to consider particular loading effects and service functions such as high local wind suction on fa√ßade elements, deflection due to wind and earthquake load, motion, occupant comfort to horizontal acceleration, internal stiffening system with integrated transportation systems and evacuation ways and vibration damping systems if required. Particularly in connection to wind effects and airflow around the building base the pedestrian wind comfort becomes an additional aspect concerning the overall architectural concept of the building shape, function and its close environment.
