# STR Assignments
## Part A
### Plan and Team Contract
Identify the parts of the project and the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for
the structures group for the 13 and 3 week period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner
to be coordinated by your PM group.
Identified parts that will help structure the work which will create the schedule,could be static
system, material, loads, combinations, element sizes, connections, design calculations, drawings etc.

## Part B
### Subjet Drawings
Drawings required to be integrated into the interdisciplinary drawings:
- Plan sketch of horizontal stabilising elements.
-	Plan sketch of vertical loaded elements.
-	Sketch of any specific and important special structure.
-	A structural detail dealing with some important connection.

## Part C
### Subject Report
After the PREVIOUS milestone you can now start calculating in more details the forces and dimensions
of your structure. Use the methods you are most familiar with. We can give some supervision
to FE-modelling but if you have no experience with this method use proper hand-calculations;
the Empire State Building was designed long before the computer era! At the end of the 13 weeks you
should have a clear idea about your structure, loads and dimensions, detailing and the integration
of special architectural features if any. Before you finish the 13-week period your project should
be at a point that you have no questions left regarding finalizing the design in the 3 weeks period.
You will get comments on the report you have to prepare at the end of the 13 weeks, which should clear
up last details.

Following aspects and issues should be addressed in the report (deliverables):
1. Development of building concept.
2. Choice of static system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates).
3. Choice of material (pure concrete, steel-concrete composite, pure or partial steel structure).
4. Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, fire and overall wind loads).
5. First verification of overall structural stability and foundation pressure.
6. Dimensions of the element profiles and sectional forces on slabs, beams, columns and core.

## Part D 
### Subject Report
The report on Subject 2 shall be delivered in electronic form as one pdf-file, containing all calculation
approaches, brief method descriptions, calculation results and drawing material. The report should be clearly
and concisely written in English. The report will be evaluated on the basis of:
1. Clarity and depth of understanding shown by the description of the chosen design, structural system,
response calculation and organization of building function.
2. Logic, accuracy and completeness of the performed design calculations.
3. Presentation and analysis of the results.

The overall and detailed structural design can be documented with:
- CAD-Drawings and
- Clear and accurate sketches - electronic or by hand.

The **Part D Subject report** is a continuation of the **Part C report**. The **Part D Subject report** report
includes details, more drawings, and more appendices including calculations. You can see it as a detailed design report.
The **Part C report** is more principles and estimates of element dimension, considerations of details. You can see
it as a concept design report.

  
### BIM
The structural system of the entire building, basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire
core, the elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof, should all be included in the
BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines.

You should be developing the BIM model through the course. This might not be possible in the early stages, however,
start as soon as possible when some elements are certain. To give you a guide you should expect to have a model that
we can do a quantity take off from by week 10. The structural system of the entire building, basement structure, ramp
access to the basement, stairs in the entire core should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other
disciplines. The elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof.
