# Structure
*The main role of structural engineers within civil engineering is the design of structures such as buildings, bridges and industrial facilities. In an ideal case structural engineers develop the initial design in partnership with architects.*

Today, the use of mathematical and numerical models of the structure to calculate the stresses that could arise from different load scenarios is common practice. In connection with the design of high-rise buildings the structural engineer needs to consider particular loading effects and service functions such as high wind on façade, deflection due to wind, motion, occupant comfort to horizontal vibrations, internal stiffening system with integrated transportation systems and evacuation ways and vibration damping systems if required. Further the soil-structure interaction in the basement could be challenging and something that need to be solved carefully. 

## Structure Requirements 

Besides the below, there will be more specific Structural Requirements included in one of the first teaching sessions. 

## Building concept 
Development of building concept, including 
* choice of static system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates). 
* Choice of material (concrete, steel, composite, etc). 
* Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, wind loads).
  
## Structural quality 
The structural quality should ensure lifetimes of 50-100 years for all essential building elements used in the building structure, facades, windows, etc. 

## Refined Design 
Refinement of preliminary design, only detailing (beams, columns, slabs, core) with respect to ventilation, floor area arrangement (individual offices, open plan office landscape, aisles, recreation areas), and façade connection to main structure. 

## Load Combinations 
Partial safety factors for different combinations and decisive load cases for overall and local structural design. 

## Structural Members 
Detail Design of structural members. 

## Dynamic Properties 
Establish dynamic properties. 

## Building Motion 
Assessment of building motion at top floors due to wind loading. 

## Buildability 
Easily buildable solutions are preferred. The construction period should be as short as possible. 

## Promote maintenance friendly solutions 
Robust and maintenance-friendly solutions should be used throughout the building. 

## Facade 
Concept design of the connection between the primary load carrying system and the secondary facade load carrying system. 

# Structures Integration

## Structures -> Architecture 

Spaces, materials, architecture e.g. 
* Do you have the spaces that the designer wishes, also after you have inserted all your columns etc. 
* Agree with the designer what kind of materials you should use, so you have sustainable materials with a good aesthetic look, but still have the required strength and stiffness. 
* Is it in general possible to solve the architectural ideas in a good and healthy static system, or do you, as a structural engineer, need to adjust the initial architectural design to get a better structural system. 

The work in subject 3 will initially be in close cooperation with Subject 1 where the main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; floor plans (including space for technical installations), design of windows, floor height, ventilation concept, heating and cooling system (especially if building integrated solutions are used), and thermal mass. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible

## Structures -> MEP 

Façade daylight, installation sizes and collisions of ducts with columns or beams, thermal bridges e.g. 

* Does your façade solutions, including columns and beams in facade, provide enough daylight into the building? Sometimes beams in the façade prevent high windows and therefore good daylight 
* Do the structural elements create thermal bridges through the insulated building envelope? 
* Do you have space for all installations, vertical and horizontal? Have you optimized the required space not to spend client’s money unwisely? Do any installation have to go through structural components, and is that a structural problem? When ducts and pipes branch out from the vertical shaft on every floor, the shaft is often significantly weakened.

## Structures -> Geotech 

Max allowable forces to foundation, global bending moment of building e.g. 
* Discuss with the geotechnical subject if the soil and the foundation system in general can be designed to handle the reaction from the high-rise. 
* Do you have tension from the high-rise, or do you only have compression. Tension can give a lot more challenges for the geotechnical subject to handle. 
* How do you deal with the spring stiffness that the soil supports the high-rise. 

## Structures -> Fire 

Fire and fire safety evacuation have main influence of structural elements e.g. 
* Structural and static choices made in subject 5 should be the same as you choose in subject 2. Especially the connections are important that subject 5 and 2 make the same choices. 
* If some elements sizes increasing because of fire loads, remember to increase it in your structural calculations. The weight will then also increase.

## Structures -> PM/ICT 

BIM model should fit with structural models e.g. 

* Structural choices have huge impact on the overall cost of the project. Please discuss this and agree if this fits in the overall economy budget for the project. 
* You should create the structural BIM Model and coordinate it with the entire BIM model. And check if there are any clash with installation, fire protection, foundation and the architectural concept in general. 
* There should be similarity between the BIM model the structural choices and structural calculations. 
* Be aware of the waste management system you chose, to remove the waste from the building and coordinate the height of the basement accordingly. Is it from –1 Level, removed by a waste management truck, that results in a higher floor to floor for –1 Level than for –2 Level and –3 Level. This results in the access ramp to be either inside or outside the excavation/retaining system area, therefore, coordination of these has to be between Geotechnical Engineer, Structural Engineer, Architect, MEP, Fire and PM.

## Structures -> Materials 

Depending on the choice of materials, the structural behaviour should be considered and analysed. As a structural engineer you should have a strong opinion of the best material for structural safety and comfort. However, architectural opinions and sustainable solution etc would be important collaborative driver for the project.
