# Structure
*The main role of structural engineers within civil engineering is the design of structures such as buildings, bridges and industrial facilities. In an ideal case structural engineers develop the initial design in partnership with architects.*

Today, the use of mathematical and numerical models of the structure to calculate the stresses that could arise from different load scenarios is common practice. In connection with the design of high-rise buildings the structural engineer needs to consider particular loading effects and service functions such as high wind on façade, deflection due to wind, motion, occupant comfort to horizontal vibrations, internal stiffening system with integrated transportation systems and evacuation ways and vibration damping systems if required. Further the soil-structure interaction in the basement could be challenging and something that need to be solved carefully. 

## Structure Requirements 

Besides the below, there will be more specific Structural Requirements included in one of the first teaching sessions. 

## Building concept 
Development of building concept, including 
* choice of static system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates). 
* Choice of material (concrete, steel, composite, etc). 
* Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, wind loads).
  
## Structural quality 
The structural quality should ensure lifetimes of 50-100 years for all essential building elements used in the building structure, facades, windows, etc. 

## Refined Design 
Refinement of preliminary design, only detailing (beams, columns, slabs, core) with respect to ventilation, floor area arrangement (individual offices, open plan office landscape, aisles, recreation areas), and façade connection to main structure. 

## Load Combinations 
Partial safety factors for different combinations and decisive load cases for overall and local structural design. 

## Structural Members 
Detail Design of structural members. 

## Dynamic Properties 
Establish dynamic properties. 

## Building Motion 
Assessment of building motion at top floors due to wind loading. 

## Buildability 
Easily buildable solutions are preferred. The construction period should be as short as possible. 

## Promote maintenance friendly solutions 
Robust and maintenance-friendly solutions should be used throughout the building. 

## Facade 
Concept design of the connection between the primary load carrying system and the secondary facade load carrying system. 

# Structures Integration

## Structures -> Architecture 

Spaces, materials, architecture e.g. 
* Do you have the spaces that the designer wishes, also after you have inserted all your columns etc. 
* Agree with the designer what kind of materials you should use, so you have sustainable materials with a good aesthetic look, but still have the required strength and stiffness. 
* Is it in general possible to solve the architectural ideas in a good and healthy static system, or do you, as a structural engineer, need to adjust the initial architectural design to get a better structural system. 

The work in subject 3 will initially be in close cooperation with Subject 1 where the main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; floor plans (including space for technical installations), design of windows, floor height, ventilation concept, heating and cooling system (especially if building integrated solutions are used), and thermal mass. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible
