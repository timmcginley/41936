# Structure -> Architecture

Spaces, materials, architecture e.g.
- Do you have the spaces that the designer wishes, also after you have inserted all your columns etc.
- Agree with the designer what kind of materials you should use, so you have sustainable materials with a good aesthetic look, but still have the required strength and stiffness.
- Is it in general possible to solve the architectural ideas in a good and healthy static system, or do you, as a structural engineer, need to adjust the initial architectural design to get a better structural system.

The work in subject Structure will initially be in close cooperation with Subject Architecture where the main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; floor plans (including space for technical installations), design of windows, floor height, ventilation concept, heating and cooling system (especially if building integrated solutions are used), and thermal mass. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible

# Structures -> MEP

Façade daylight, installation sizes and collisions of ducts with columns or beams, thermal bridges e.g.
- Does your façade solutions, including columns and beams in facade, provide enough daylight into the building? Sometimes beams in the façade prevent high windows and therefore good daylight
- Do the structural elements create thermal bridges through the insulated building envelope?
- Do you have space for all installations, vertical and horizontal? Have you optimized the required space not to spend client’s money unwisely? Do any installation have to go through structural components, and is that a structural problem? When ducts and pipes branch out from the vertical shaft on every floor, the shaft is often significantly weakened.

# Structures -> PM/ICT

BIM model should fit with structural models e.g.
- Structural choices have huge impact on the overall cost of the project. Please discuss this and agree if this fits in the overall economy budget for the project.
- You should create the structural BIM Model and coordinate it with the entire BIM model. And check if there are any clash with installation, fire protection, foundation and the architectural concept in general.
- There should be similarity between the BIM model the structural choices and structural calculations.
- Be aware of the waste management system you chose, to remove the waste from the building and coordinate the height of the basement accordingly. Is it from –1 Level, removed by a waste management truck, that results in a higher floor to floor for –1 Level than for –2 Level and –3 Level. This results in the access ramp to be either inside or outside the excavation/retaining system area, therefore, coordination of these has to be between Structural Engineer, Architect, MEP, and PM.
