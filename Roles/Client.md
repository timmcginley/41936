# Client

The client is an annonymous benefactor who wants to fund the transformation of a buildinsg at DTU.
In this scenario, DTU Cas have suggested buildings 115, 304 and 308. So the client wants your team to work out:
* Which building should they transform?
* Hwo should they transform it?
* How much will it cost?
* How can the additional accomodation be added to the existing at a minimal C02 Kg eq / user?
* How long will it take to build?

## DTU Fri
The transformed building will house both the existing departmental accomodation of the bulding and the new programme for a new 'non' department at DTU called DTU Fri. DTU Fri is not really a department, it does not have any faculty, it doesn't even have any administration. All it has is an online booking service where project space can be booked both ad hoc and in advance.

## So who do we ask?
As DTU Fri does not exist yet and will not have any management strcture when it does, the driving force behind the project is the benefactor. However they have said that they do not have the answers (apart from what they have provided in this website) and expect you to get the needs of existing staff and students and evidence this in your reports. You should do this by asking /interviewing representative groups. It is also ok for you to share information, so the same groups aren't asked 16 times. PMs should coordinate and share the user requirements as they are discovered.

## So who is the benefactor?
The funding is annonymous but we know that it is a previous student that has been very successful in deep tech development and investments since leaving DTU.

## Conditions
* The client is in ultimate control of the design of the building
* The client pays each teams via invoice upon satisfactory completion of each stage.
* The client reserves the right to change the design requirements if necessary during the process.
* Teams should are advised to develop a 'parametric' approach to the project so they can adapt to changes.
* The client will write a letter at the completion of each stage offering feedback to the teams
* Only the course responsible is authorised to talk with the client.
* Any questions for the client should be relayed through the course responsible prior to the completion of the stage.
