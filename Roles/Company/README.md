# Company

**N.B you are not expected to create a 'real' company, but part of the course is to give you a realistic experience of starting and managing your own consultancy. So we simulate it.**

Your 'company' has the following responsibilities:
* Don't go bankrupt
* Pay all employees on time
* Write invoices to the PMs (except PMs who write to the client).
* Produce work on time.
* Act professionally at all times
* Speak up when you are not sure
* Engage in continuous professional development of
* Put the needs of the project first and accept change as part of the process.

Once you have chosen your subject. You can then create a company within the project. 

All companies start with an operating budget of 100.000 DKK.

You must declare when you start your project if you will charge 700, 900 or 1.100 DKK per person per hour.

You will be audited at the end of the project as part of the assessment of your performance. It is therefore important to carefully log your hours and invoice the project manager in a timely manner.
