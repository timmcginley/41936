# MEP Requirements

## Facade and room dimensions
Design the facade focusing on:
- Glazing share of the facade
- The sun shading system, you should consider
- Visual comfort (glare etc. - Check DS_EN 17037_2018)
- Overheating
- Good daylighting conditions (is possible use Daylight Autonomy (DS_EN 17037)
- how the facade of the building affects indoor climate.
Design the rooms focusing on:
-	possible depth of rooms where permanent work spaces are possible
-	room height

# Tech floor basement
Technical floor basement requirement is probably the same as the building footprint. It is important that this need is communicated to the architecture team. An initial layout of the functions should be included in the drawings. Do consider how to get from technical room to shaft (e.g. ventilation ducts take up a lot of room)
# Energy frame
The energy requirements to be fulfilled in the project is equal to those put forward in the Building Code preferably including energy frame requirements from the low energy class.
# Indoor climate
The thermal and atmospheric indoor climate must correspond to at least Category II in EN 15251.
# Daylight
Daylight requirements at workspaces are important. Meeting rooms and corridors have no formal daylight requirements. Adjust the footprint of the building so workspaces have daylight and avoid unusable space.
Daylight must meet either one of the following requirements based on the Danish building code minimum requirements and DS/EN 17037 further specified in:
1.	There should be 300 lux in at least half of the area with permanent workspaces in at least 50% of the hours with daylight. This is the preferred solution (daylight autonomy)
2.	As a workaround, daylight may be documented with a daylight factor of 2.1% in at least half the area with workspaces and at least 0.7% on all workspaces.
# Daylight Autonomy
Solutions with high levels of daylight autonomy are preferred by the Client. You can use daylight autonomy actively to reduce window size and cooling load in highly solar loaded rooms.
# Acoustic Requirements
Acoustic requirements according to national Danish regulation.
# Comfort supply concept
Heating, cooling and ventilation can be supplied to the room in a number of different ways. They each have different advantages and disadvantages in terms of energy, indoor climate and space requirements. You need to ensure that you choose a system which can be integrated with the other subjects.
# Thermal simulations
The optimal combination of low energy consumption and good indoor climate (including daylight) must be found using some sort of sensitivity parameter variation routine. This optimization should be done using IDA ICE (or similar). The purpose is to find the optimal set of parameters in combination with the other design requirements by the other subjects. This sensitivity analysis is a major input from subject 3 to the discussion and shaping/design of the building.
The data from the following table must be used in setting up the thermal simulations.

| Room   |m2 pr. person   | Watt/person   | Equipment Watt/person   |Lighting W/m2   | Other equipment W/m2   | Notes  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Landscape office   | 8   | 90   | 90   | 5   | 3   | Note 3,5   |
| Single office  | 10 | 90   | 90   | 7   | 3   |   |
| Print and copying room   |   |   |   | 100   | 100  | Note 6   |
| Reception   | 20   |   |   | 8   | 3   |   |
| Canteen   | 1.5   | 90   |   | 5   | 3   | Note 1   |
| Kitchen incl. secondary spaces  |   |   |   |   | 3   | Note 2   |
| Meeting rooms   | 2   | 90   | 25   | 8   | 20   | Note 4   |

Note 1: Area calculated excluding buffet area.
Note 2: Heat gain determined after kitchen design.
Note 3: The following occupancy load is used:
- Kl. 8-11 80 %
- Kl. 11-13 25 % (lunch break)
- Kl. 13-16 80 %
- Kl. 16-17 25 %
Note 4: The following occupancy load is used in meeting rooms:
- Kl. 8-12 100 %
- Kl. 12-13 0 % (lunch break)
- Kl. 13-15 100 %
- Kl. 15-17 50 %
Note 5: The area includes the whole floor area including corridors, walking areas, break-out spaces etc. In practice the occupancy load in the landscape office is probably 6-7 m2/person.
Note 6: Concurrency means that the load in the printer rooms from equipment will be 20 W/m²

Generally
- Equipment: comprise laptops and screens and other person-related equipment like IP-telephone, mobile charger, height adjustable desks etc.
- Other equipment: comprise load from equipment that is not person-related, like projectors, flat screens, photocopiers, printers etc. Comprise also standby-load from building control systems like sensors, motors, actuators, wi-fi etc., totalling 3 W/m².
- There are no smokers in the entire building.

# Heating and cooling
The energy supply system must supply heating and cooling to the building to meet the demand. The room heat supply can be by radiators, convectors, floor heating or other that integrates well with the other building services. Heat production should be from district heating, however electrical heat pumps and/or, solar thermal should be considered as a supplement. Cooling preferably from district cooling, and/or compressor cooling. It is important to show that the heating and cooling system in the rooms of the building are able to supply sufficient heating and cooling. This must be documented based on simulations for cooling in selected rooms (taken from the thermal simulations based on the chosen design parameters from the sensitivity analyses). For heating it should be documented that the building can uphold 20C with -12C outdoor, as described in DS418.
#High rise building
As you are designing a high-rise building, you must also define and document how heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, cold water, sewage, sprinkling is laid out in the building. You will also need to include several pressure zones for heating and cooling and specific floors for technical installations mainly due to ventilation requirements.
# Space management in shafts
The space required in the shafts should be considered and included in the design. You should also be aware that the other installations such as sewage, water, electrical cabling and garbage should also be considered. You should not make detailed design in your project, but you must make sure that there is room for this. Notice that the pressure zones in a high-rise building mean that you need more than one set of pipes for e.g. heating, cooling and water supply. You should work closely with subject 6 and 1 for this.
# Space management on floors
On the floors the input from subject 3 is to make sure that the design ensures acceptable indoor climate fulfilling the requirements. As part of this, the space required for technical installations (mainly due to ventilation) must be sufficiently included in the design. This is the case in both a vertical and horizontal direction.
# Space management in basement 
Make sure that there is sufficient space for the technical installations in the basement. There should be allocated areas for heating, cooling, fire station, ventilation (if applicable), sewage, electrical switchboards. The layout should enable seamless integration with the shafts. 
# Maintenance access
Optimal access to technical installations in plant rooms and along ducts and pipes.
