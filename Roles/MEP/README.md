# MEP
*The subject concerns building services and building energy has the purpose of ensuring that the building has low energy consumption and acceptable indoor climate concerning both thermal and atmospheric air quality as well as day lighting conditions.*

In the MEP subject, the work is to establish the technical design parameters of the building. This comprises both passive and active design strategies which is to be implemented in concepts for heating, cooling and ventilation. Therefore, MEP Subject will work with room dimensions, daylight, façade design, ventilation type, heating and cooling supply, thermal simulations. One specific issue is to develop a system which will work in a high-rise building, which means that location of technical floors (mainly ventilation), pressure zones and space needed for the supply must be considered. The work in the subject requires – at least in the early phases – a large amount of coordination and integration with mainly subject 1, but also subject 2 and 5 are very important partners. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible.
