# MEP
*The subject concerns building services and building energy has the purpose of ensuring that the building has low energy consumption and acceptable indoor climate concerning both thermal and atmospheric air quality as well as day lighting conditions.*

In subject 3, the work is to establish the technical design parameters of the building. This comprises both passive and active design strategies which is to be implemented in concepts for heating, cooling and ventilation. Therefore, subject 3 will work with room dimensions, daylight, façade design, ventilation type, heating and cooling supply, thermal simulations. One specific issue is to develop a system which will work in a high-rise building, which means that location of technical floors (mainly ventilation), pressure zones and space needed for the supply must be considered. The work in the subject requires – at least in the early phases – a large amount of coordination and integration with mainly subject 1, but also subject 2 and 5 are very important partners. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible.

## MEP Requirements

## Facade and room dimensions
Design the facade focusing on:
* Transparency of the façade (glazing share)
* Solar shading system, you should consider resilience to high winds and maintenance costs
* Visual comfort (glare etc. - Check DS_EN 17037_2018)
* Overheating. How the facade of the building affects indoor climate.
* Good daylighting conditions (document with spatial Daylight Autonomy (DS_EN 17037, sDA300-50%))

Design the rooms focusing on:
* possible depth of rooms where permanent work spaces are possible
* Optimal room height. Consider room height for permanent workspaces and room heigh in corridors. It
does not have to be the same

## Tech floors and tech basement
The ventilation units must be placed to minimize the pressure loss. This often translates into tech floors dedicated to building services. You must early on estimate the space required for ventilation. It is important that this need is communicated to the architecture team.

The technical basementis probably the same size as the building footprint. The basement will have centrals for heating, cooling, hot water, sprinkling, ventilation, IT and power. It is prudent to place centrals close to the shafts that they serve. An initial layout of the functions should be included in the drawings. Do consider how to get from city grid to technical central to shaft (e.g. ventilation ducts take up a lot of room)

## Energy frame
The energy requirements to be fulfilled in the project is equal to those put forward in the Building Code preferably including energy frame requirements from the low energy class.

## Indoor climate
The thermal and atmospheric indoor climate must correspond to at least Category II in EN 16798.

## Daylight
Daylight requirements at workspaces are important. Meeting rooms and corridors have no formal daylight requirements. Adjust the footprint of the building so workspaces have daylight and avoid unusable space.

Daylight must meet either one of the following requirements based on the Danish building code minimum requirements and DS/EN 17037 further specified in:

* There should be 300 lux in at least half of the area with permanent workspaces in at least 50% of the hours with daylight. This is the preferred solution (daylight autonomy, sDA300,50%). Use latest IDA ICE version for this.

* As an (emergency) workaround, daylight may be documented with a daylight factor of 2.1% in at least half the area with workspaces and at least 0.7% on all workspaces.

## Daylight Autonomy
Solutions with high levels of daylight autonomy are preferred by the Client. You can use daylight autonomy actively to reduce window size and cooling load in highly solar loaded rooms. Use daylight autonomy to optimize window sizes for different orientations. In this way cooling load is optimized without compromising daylight.

## Acoustic Requirements
Acoustic requirements according to national Danish regulation. Consider both room acoustics and noise from technical installations.

## Comfort supply concept
Heating, cooling and ventilation can be supplied to the room in a number of different ways. They each have different advantages and disadvantages in terms of energy, indoor climate and space requirements. You need to ensure that you choose a system which can be integrated with the other subjects. Consider that using systems that can provide both heating and cooling may be cost-optimal, but they require a lot more discipline integration and operation is more complicated.

## Thermal simulations
The optimal combination of low energy consumption and good indoor climate (including daylight) must be found using some sort of sensitivity parameter variation routine. This optimization should be done using IDA ICE (or similar). The purpose is to find the optimal set of parameters in combination with the other design requirements by the other subjects. This sensitivity analysis is a major input from subject 3 to the discussion and shaping/design of the building.

The data from the following table must be used in setting up the thermal simulations.


Note 1: Area calculated excluding buffet area.
Note 2: Heat gain determined after kitchen design.
Note 3: The following occupancy load is used:
* Kl. 8-11 80 %
* Kl. 11-13 25 % (lunch break)
* Kl. 13-16 80 %
* Kl. 16-17 25 %

Note 4: The following occupancy load is used in meeting rooms:
* Kl. 8-12 100 %
* Kl. 12-13 0 % (lunch break)
* Kl. 13-15 100 %
* Kl. 15-17 50 %

Note 5: The area includes the whole floor area including corridors, walking areas, break-out spaces etc. In practice the occupancy load in the landscape office is probably 6-7 m2/person.
Note 6: Concurrency means that the load in the printer rooms from equipment will be 20 W/m².

Generally
* Equipment: comprises laptops and screens and other person-related equipment like IP-telephone, mobile charger, height adjustable desks etc.
* Other equipment: comprises load from equipment that is not person-related, like projectors, flat screens, photocopiers, printers etc. Comprises also standby-load from building control systems like sensors, motors, actuators, wi-fi etc., totalling 3 W/m².
* There are no smokers in the entire building.

## Heating and cooling
The energy supply system must supply heating and cooling to the building to meet the demand. The room heat supply can be by radiators, convectors, floor heating or other that integrates well with the other building services. Heat production should be from district heating, however electrical heat pumps and/or, solar thermal should be considered as a supplement. Cooling preferably from district cooling, and/or compressor cooling. It is important to show that the heating and cooling system in the rooms of the building are able to supply sufficient heating and cooling. This must be documented based on simulations for cooling in selec ted rooms (taken from the thermal simulations based on the chosen design parameters from the sensitivity analyses). For heating it should be documented that the building can uphold 20C with -12C outdoor, as described in DS469.

## High-rise building
As you are designing a high-rise building, you must also define and document how heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, cold water, sewage, sprinkling is laid out in the building. You will also need to include several pressure zones for heating and cooling and specific tech floors mainly due to ventilation requirements.

## Space management in shafts
The space required in the shafts should be considered and included in the design. You should also be aware that the other installations such as sewage, water, electrical cabling and garbage should also be considered. You should not make detailed design in your project, but you must make sure that there is room for this. Notice that the pressure zones in a high-rise building mean that you need more than one set of pipes for e.g. heating, cooling and water supply. You should work closely with subject 6 and 1 for this.

## Space management on floors
On the floors the input from subject 3 is to make sure that the design ensures acceptable indoor climate fulfilling the requirements. As part of this, the space required for technical installations (mainly due to ventilation) must be sufficiently included in the design. This is the case in both a vertical and horizontal direction.

## Space management in basement
Make sure that there is sufficient space for the technical installations in the basement. There should be allocated areas for heating, cooling, fire station, ventilation (if applicable), sewage, electrical switchboards. The layout should enable seamless integration with the shafts.

## Maintenance access
Optimal access to technical installations in plant rooms and along ducts and pipes.

# MEP Integration

## MEP -> Architecture
The work in subject 3 will initially be in close cooperation with Subject 1 where the main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; floor plans (including space for technical installations), design of windows, floor height, ventilation concept, heating and cooling system (especially if building integrated solutions are used), and thermal mass. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible.

It is important for the work in subject 3 that it is coordinated with the work from the other subjects - mainly subject 1 and 2. An example of this coordination is to estimate how much space is required for the ventilation system and other technical installations in both the horizontal (on the floor) and vertical direction (shafts). Consider which services to put in basement, at technical floors and close to skybar. This must initially be based on rules of thumb, but later on based on more advanced methods.

## MEP -> Structures
It is important very early on to establish the floor height including room height, deck construction and the cavity above the suspended ceiling (if you have one). This needs input from subject 1, 2 and 3.

Beams in façade take window height and daylight. Are there designated spaces for routing of installations? Do installations collide with columns or beams? E.g. are the radiator pipes at the façade blocked by columns or do beams block the ducting?

* Do the structural elements create thermal bridges through the insulated building envelope? This is relevant for façade but also for roof or basement floors that separates heated space from parking space.

* Do the installation have to go through structural components, and is that a structural problem? Small holes in some parts of the beam is often acceptable

## MEP -> Fire
Make sure that there is sufficient space allocated for sprinkling, a tech room for fire, air pressurization of staircases and elevators to keep them free of smoke.

## MEP -> Geotech
City water, sewage, electricity, power, internet, heating (and sometimes cooling) come to the building through the ground. Service stations in basement are necessary.

* Allocate space for city services in basement. Allocate space for horizontal routing from service stations to shafts. Consider potential collisions with beams/columns and consider if routing is on the heated or cold side of the building envelope (heated side is better).
* Possibly allocate space for ventilation units in basement. Ventilation units need fresh air intake and exhaust at ground level and connections to shafts.
* Consider other functions in basement that needs MEP: fitness, dancehall, showers, changing rooms, depots and archives, cleaning rooms, server rooms etc.
* Parking space needs fans to extract pollution

## MEP -> PM/ICT
MEP constitutes a significant share of total costs. Air-borne heating and cooling may be cheap to purchase but occupies more rentable space than hydronic h/c systems. Therefore, the MEP has to coordinate with the PM from cost perspective, BIM Model quality assurance and space management.

* Be aware of the waste management system you chose, to remove the waste from the building and coordinate the height of the basement accordingly. Is it from –1 Level, removed by a waste management truck, that results in a higher floor to floor for –1 Level than for –2 Level and –3 Level. That provides a bigger volume floor to floor x area, for the MEP – 1 Level technical floor. This results in the access ramp to be either inside or outside the excavation/retaining system area, therefore, coordination of these has to be between Geotechnical Engineer, Structural Engineer, Architect,MEP, Fire and PM.

## MEP -> Materials
MEP has only small impact on materials, but has significant share of the overall LCA, because operation energy constitutes approx. ½ of the total energy that goes into a building over the lifetime. From an LCA perspective it is crucial to minimise operation energy.

Also thermal mass or rather lack of thermal mass, because lighter materials are more sustainable, requires MEP to be more vigilant when determining design parameters as less thermal mass impacts indoor climate and sometimes energy.
