# Teacher (Chief Consultant)

**To encourge a professional attitude in the students, the 'teacher role' is reframed as that of 'Chief Consultant' with the following responsibilities:**

your subject teacher in this course should be thought of as the Cheif Consultant. The scenario is that you have a company that you are responsible for but not so much exeprience, so theri is someone you cna ask for advice. But all decisions are ultimately your responsiblity. Additionally it si unlikely that the cheif consultatn will conssder the needs of the other disciplines as this is your role, they will just tell you wht is best for your discipline.

* Decide on and deliver a limited number of 'lectures' at relevant points in the course to add core knowledge
* Focus on supporting interdisciplinary collaboration based on the students existing knowledge
* Attend a monthly 'cheif consultant meeting' (lunch time mondays) to align the needs of the students.
