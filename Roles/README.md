# Roles

As a member of the design team you will perform one of the following roles. You should have expertise / experience / enthusiasm for the role you choose, but equally importantly you hsould empathy for the other disciplines. We are trying to make, better, more sustainable buildings, eventually the best buildings in the world - we cannot do that wihtout supporting each other in the design process.

The Advanced Building Design course for 2025 has 6 subjects to choose from.

* [Architecture](/41936/Roles/Architecture)
* [Structure](/41936/Roles/Structure)
* [MEP](/41936/Roles/MEP)
* [Geotech](/41936/Roles/Geotech)
* [Materials](/41936/Roles/Materials)
* [PM/ICT](/41936/Roles/PM-ICT)

*The intention of the course is to develop a disruptive new meta disciplinary design process grounded in strong disciplinary expertise. In the traditional design process the architect takes the lead, and the other participants
wait to receive the basic design. 

This approach is no longer fit for purpose, the whole design team needs to be involved to make better, more sustainable buidings.

The traditional process is still the most commonly in the industry, you may be familiar with this from your own experience, but that is not what we are doing here, if you are out of your comfort zone and acknowledging and supporting other disciplines outside of their comfort zone you are 'doing it right'.*

So, if you are waiting for information from another role, why are you waiting, see if:

1. you could help them, maybe they are stuck and would appreciate your guidance?
2. could you agree with them on some assumptions so you do not have to wait and can plug in their 'real' input when it is ready.
