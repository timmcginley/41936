# Roles
It is not the intention of the course to use the
traditional design process in which, essentially, the
architect takes the lead, and the other participants
wait to receive the basic design from the architect.
That process is still the most commonly used method in
the industry, and students may be familiar with the
process from their student jobs. However, the lack of
input from different roles in such a process can
prevent the achievement of a sustainable solution.

The Advanced Building Design course for 2024 has 4 subjects to choose from.

* [Architecture](/41936/Roles/Architecture)
* [Structure](/41936/Roles/Structure)
* [MEP](/41936/Roles/MEP)
* [PM/ICT](/41936/Roles/PM-ICT)
