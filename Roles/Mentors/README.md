# Course Mentors

Advanced Building Design Mentors, select groups based on their [Assignment 1](Assignments/A) presentation.


The course is mentored by industry representatives. They will select which teams they will mentor based on you performance in the first assignment.

There will be three different types of mentors representing the three common types of Architecture Engineering collaboration in building design that we see today. We are really excited about this new approach.

## Type 1 - Engineers in the Architecture Office
Typically where a large Architecture practice has seen value in employing engineers to increase building design integration. Criteria: Architects and Engineers in the same building. This would also include interdisciplinary that were established wiht the idea to include both architects and engineers for instance [SOM](https://www.som.com/).

Examples of this would be [BIG](https://big.dk/) Engineering.

## Type 2 - Engineer Office in the same corporate group as Architecture Office
Typically where a large Engineering firm has seen value in 'buying' an Architecture practice.

Examples of this are [Ramb√∏ll](https://www.ramboll.com/) and [Henning Larsen](https://henninglarsen.com/en).

## Type 3 - Engineer and Architect only linked through the project.
This is the traditional context for architectural engineering collaboration. The Engineer and Architects are employed by seperate companies that are not part of the same group.
Examples of this would be [Buro Happold](https://www.burohappold.com/) and [3XN/GXN](https://gxn.3xn.com/).
