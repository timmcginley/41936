# Materials / LCA
*The materials subject is a new subject in Advanced Building Design. We have added it to support greater investigation of different material options in project. Including their LCA implications. Additionally the subject is responsible for the DGNB-Lite documentation of the project.*

*This subject explores the emerging potential of an architectural materials engineer as an integral part of the building design team.*

## Material Requirements 

Besides the below, there will be more specific Structural Requirements included in one of the first teaching sessions. 

## Sustainability and the build environment
A central part of this subject is to understand and potentially challenge the taken for granted, In regard to how we build. This is done from a sustainability point of perspective. But how can we argue that something is sustainable and what does that entail. during the subject you will explore and try to define sustainability in context to your building project.

## Green Building Rating Systems
A central criterion for the high-rise building is the DGNB lite certification. A simplified version of the GBRS, DGNB, that is the most common used in Denmark. A green building rating system functions both as a tool to documentation but should also be considered as a set of criteria's that can help support or define parts of the building design process. Understanding these criteria, where and how they affect your teams process and what measures you can plan out to accommodate the needed information at the right time to the right people. DGNB screening and initial process plotting for knowledge sharing or interventions.

## DGNB lite Requirements
Identify, analyse and delegate DGNB lite requirements to the different subject groups. Inform and plan with PMs to align with DMS continually through the process. Develop and performco-design processes across the building team to develop solutions. Balancing the needs of different disciplines and the DGNB lite requirements through development of metrics and decision support tools.

## Circularity in the build environment and life circle assessment
Principles of circular economy has increasingly become a part of how the future is envisioned also within the build environment. This means that we need to both understand the current linear life cycle of a building, as well as how we can begin to reimagine and design buildings from a more circular perspective. Part of this is being able to account on the impact of different actions such as mining for iron, casting foundation or heating the building. It is however also to put a value on these effects and their impact on both the global and local environment. Her we use Life cycle assessment both as a tool for documenting the expected effects of the building, but also to inform and guide the design process, by highlighting problematic material uses or enabling us to create scenarios of different designs and compare them.

## Understand and balance the needs of the different disciplines.
The building project can be viewed is an arena of development. Consisting of different actors with different values, strengths, and shortcomings. There are global rules of what you can do within this arena but also local rules of thumb within the different disciplines, that sometimes blind them from seeing alternatives to business as usual. You can almost se them as different cultures with different values that they worship and put above all else in their priorities, going into this project arena: Aesthetics, resilience, strength, ease of maintenance, safety, agile process…

In many ways you are the new actor entering in an already existing arena, the new kid on the block. Therefore, you need to understand the different actors of the arena, their values, priorities, and stakes in this Arena. Where do they align and where might they clash? Where is the opportunities and need for collaboration? From this understanding you are better able to create tools for negotiation between these different values and how the different requirements, values and needs can be combined and co-designed into something more than its parts.

## Sustainable project navigation
Aligning The different subject groups values and priorities and strategically navigating them towards a shared goal is no easy task, and the subject of sustainability is not always at the forefront of every other team's mind in decision making and co-design process.

It is your task to bring the project team together and create value and anchorage in the different the subject teams to pursue more sustainable solutions.

## PerformLCA on the building.
During this project initial faces, you will need to Create an initial baseline model that can support early identification of hotspots in the design of the building sketch and support prioritised decision making, in later scenario development. The scenarios you develop should be to a degree that enables informed decision making with clear evaluations on information shortcomings, advantages, and drawback from an Environmental performance standpoint. The hope is to support a transdisciplinary process of knowledge sharing and prioritisation and decision making.

Lastly you will need to create a complete LCA of the building including all the regulation required life cycle stages. Pay attention and document all insecurities or shortcomings in your model as well as a discussion and perspectivation of the final LCA analysis and results.

It is expected that you manage to keep a information link to the LCA calculation tools (including your Life cycle inventory) and the interface to the BIM models, so there is a clear project model alignment through the process.

Coordinate with the PM on how to achieve this and make sure this is included in the DMS.

## Material knowledge, search and strategies for sustainable building design
The materials that go into constructing a building is vast in quantity, taking up and imbedding large amounts of resources and energy in a structure for decades.

To design and build more sustainable buildings now and in the future, we need to gain a better understanding of the direct and indirect effects and consequences of the materials we choose to use, how they are put together and perform as well as how we mange them when they are not going to be part of our building anymore.

Here the material subject people have a critical role in identifying problematic materials or building designs. Using an array of design tools and methods to both map out and communicate the issues as well as enabling collaborative processes with the relevant subject groups involved, to develop alternative material or design proposals.

# Material Integration

## Material -> Architecture 
Support decision making through collaboration around circular design strategies. Support in material choices and knowledge along the decision process. Key in communicating needs and criterias of other subjects and ensure strategic collaborative processes with relevant subject groups along the design process.

## Material -> Structure 
Support structure subject to make material decisions on the structure of the building. Collaboratively define the structural unit of the structure to support the LCA calculations. Encourage the structures subject to provide information early to you and make assumptions where appropriate to support your calculations. Develop and collaborate on dynamic life cycle inventory “material model” of the building and its parts.


## Material -> MEP 
Coordinate closely with the MEP subject to establish the scope of the LCA regarding heating, energy use, water use scenarios for replacement/service, as well as additional energy and resource use, in the “use” face of the buildings life cycle. The material subject should collaborate on identifying opportunities for green innovation or optimization as well as representing the needs of the MEP subjects focus.

## Material -> Geotech 
Whilst there may be more limited options for materials in the Geotech, early quantification and exploration of the impacts of the proposals will support the Geotech subject investigations. Geotech and Material should collaborate on mapping potential local environmental concerns in regards to the building process and use, ground water levels, potential chemical pollution, earth absorption levels exec. Again, it is important to consider assumptions to support the articulation and deliberation of different options as well as considering the complex interactions and effects of constructing a building.

## Material -> Fire 
A core role of the subject group is to help the team to explore the important relationship between sustainability and safety. Your role here is to listen to the needs of the different subjects and produce options that helps them to make decisions about the best way forward.

Introducing new or lesser used materials in a building can in some cases be a fire safety concern, therefore it is central that you collaborate around material selection criteria’s and limitations, as well as being able to communicate/translate these to the other subject teams.

Ultimately you are responsible for the materials and can ‘override’ other groups, but this would not be a good option if you have not considered their needs – it should be a compromise.

## Material -> PM/ICT 
This collaboration should be clearly defined in the DMS.

Clear communication and planning between PM and MAT is central for the intended collaboration and co -design process as well as managing expectations and prioritising in the planning of the project and the goals set for different subjects.Material should also continuously communicate and collaborate on achieving the DGNB lite goal and documenting it appropriately.




















# Fire
*The subject of fire safety is divided into a part 1, focusing on the safety of occupants, and a part 2, focusing on the structural fire safety. This structure, reflects the timeline of a fire, which can also be divided into two main phases:*

* A pre-flashover phase, including an ignition phase and a growing phase, as combustible materials in the room are successively ignited and the fire spread in the compartment. In the pre-flashover phase, two zones can be identified in the compartment, a lower cooler zone and an upper zone filled with smoke and characterized by high temperatures. The premises should be promptly evacuated, as people safety can be at risk due to smoke in-halation and lack of visibility.

* A post-flashover phase, including a fully developed fire phase and a decay phase, where temperature decreases as the fuel is consumed and the fire is extinguished. In the post-flashover phase the temperature of the gas, which are assumed to be uniform within the compartment, heat the structural elements, which may be at risk of failure.

## Fire Requirements 

## Core fire safety
An open staircase is not enough, there need to be several staircases with a fire cell around (staircase in a core). This can also be staircases on the façade as seen on building 127 (DTU).

* 30 meters distance from any point (so maximum 30m walk to a staircase. So, the maximum distance between staircases is 60m).
* Min. 1.2 meters wide (+ 10 mm pr. person passing) (sizing of staircase if you want to calculate the size Not so important right now)
* Exits (to the open)
* 25 meters distance from any point (Meaning where need to be maximum 25 meters to a door leading to hallway with a staircase)
* Structure: Staircase as a fire cell

## Part 1: Safety of occupants
The following aspects need to be considered in fire safety in the pre-flashover phase:

* evacuation,
* fire spread,
* access of the rescue service,
* passive and active fire protection and
* operation and

In order to secure fire safety within high-rise buildings, the pre-flashover phase has additional requirements.

During the course you can choose to work on:

## Option 1:Minimumfire safety
If you use minimum requirement your team has to follow traditional building rules (no atria, large compartments etc.).

## Option 2: Fire safety as a focus domain with full requirements
If you plan an untraditional building, including large open spaces, you must take care of the full requirements for fire safety.

* For traditional part of the building you should apply the prescriptive rules given in “Eksempelsamling om brandsikring af byggeri 2012” [1] (Unfortunately this document is only available in Danish).
* Remember, that you are free to build anything you want as long as you can verify that people can evacuate without being affected by critical conditions [2]. This you will have to pick relevant scenarios, proof the fire safety using at least hand calculations and make risk calculations and present an event tree.

Please have a look at the File “11080 EÅ19 – FIRE - Further details on fire requirements” for more details. [TO DO: Ask teachers for more information] 

## Part 2: Structural fire safety
You are expected to design and verify that your structure can resist fire. You are allowed to limit your design to a number of structural elements, but you should at least consider:
* one beam
* one column
* one floor slab

The three elements do not necessarily have to be placed in the same compartment and should instead be chosen among those, which are expected to be most critical for fire design, because they are for example heavily loaded or highly exposed to fire. If untraditional elements are present in the building, such as long cantile vers, steel cables, wood connections, or other elements that for some reasons can be expected to have a critical behaviour during a fire, you should also explicitly perform the fire design of those elements too. Special attention should be also paid to elements, the failure of which could lead to disproportionate damage, such as a transfer beam or other key elements, which play a strategic role in carrying the loads to the ground.

Please have a look at the file “11080 FÅ22 – Subj.5 - How to fulfil fire requirements” formore details. [TO DO: Askteachers for more information]

# Fire Integration

## Fire -> Architecture 
* The design of staircases and rescue staircases
* The distribution of spaces chosen determines the choice and size of compartments
* The intended destination of usage influences the loads
* The type of facades and internal walls affects the calculation of thermal inertia
* The presence of suspended ceiling influences the height of the smoke layer and may reduce the temperature of the structural elements behind the ceiling (if fire tight)
* Fire design choices such as type and amount of insulations may be incompatible with aesthetic or architectonic needs
* The type and material of enclosures should fulfil the fire rating and provide sufficient compartmentalization.

## Fire -> Structure 
* structural choices have a great impact on the fire design and should be discussed and agreed with all the group members since the very early stage of the project
* The structural and static scheme chosen in Subj. 2 should be consistent with those used for fire calculations
* Constructive details (e.g. the way a floor slab is supported by the beams) affect the section factor and therefore the temperature of the elements
* Modifications on the element size or material for being compliant with fire verifications reflects on the weight and stiffness of the structure assumed in Subj. 2 and vice-versa. This means that it may be necessary to recalculate the whole structure after the fire verifications. Please take into account this time, so that the modifications to the structure can be documented in the 3-week report at latest.

## Fire -> MEP 
* ventilation systems might influence the smoke spread in the building and the opening factor of the compartment
* Energy saving materials and wall insulation affect the calculation of the thermal inertia of the compartment
* when designing the pipe system, attention should be paid to the definition of fire compartments and possible escape of smoke and fire from holes and venting in the walls
* Consider fire safety installations for fire extinguishing, overpressure in staircases, etc.
* The type of beam-slab system used may affect the space you have for the installation; holes made to let pipes through structural elements strongly increase the exposure and heating temperature of the elements, as well as the complexity and of the insulating solutions.

## Fire -> Geotech 
* Limitations of fire spread in the underground parking lot
* Evacuation from the underground parking lot

## Fire -> PM/ICT 
The fire subject needs support from ICT/PM to model the costs of different fire engineering options.

* Fire strategy and insulation choices have a great impact on the overall costs and should be discussed and agreed among the group members. Attention should be paid on the effect of the fire design choices on the overall economy, sustainability and resilience of the building and in particular
* Evacuation strategy: cost related to training of staff and occupants, maintenance of the alarm systems etc
* Active measures: cost related to installing and maintenance of the sprinkler system or other fire suppression provisions.
* Passive measures: amount and type of insulations influences the costs of the building (for example, fire resistant glasses are beautiful, but often uneconomical; intumescent paint is also a good aesthetic choice, but is more expensive and less reliable of other type of insulations; furthermore, some type of painting can be toxic and have repercussion on the people and environment).
* Structural elements: composite sections such as delta-beams and concrete filled steel hollow section may have better fire performance than steel sections, due to the heat capacity of the concrete that absorb part of the heat; it is however not possible to take this aspect into account by means of simple calculations. This means that, unless you are not willing to spend significant time by implementing a thermal model of the section e.g. in Abaqus, you will conservatively verify the sole external steel section against fire. The result is that the benefit of using a composite section (which costs and weight more than a steel section) are completely lost after the fire verification, where you also add additional costs for the insulation. The use of composite sections should therefore be considered car efully and all related costs of materials and insulation should be documented in Subj.6. Similar considerations also apply to hollow-core slabs that need bottom insulation in order to prevent cracking of the flange below the holes and a consequent faster heating of the element [10].
* Cost management: All system used for fire safety and structural fire safety should be added in the total cost of the building.

## Fire -> Materials
* Concrete is often considered to have good fire behaviour, but it is permanently damaged by the fire, while structural steel regain full strength after cooling. On the other side, steel elements typically need to be insulated and the cost of fire protection must be added to the structural costs. In short, there is no ultimate better material for fire, as long as all costs are included and a design optimization is considered, where both the costs of the structural material and of the insulation are considered.
* A special mention goes to timber, as it pose special challenges to fire safety for three main reasons:
* * from the structural point of view, a full timber structure constitutes a significant addition to the fuel load of the compartments (even if it is not directly exposed);
* * from the evacuation point of view, exposed timber causes smoke and hinders evacuation;
* * consequently, from the compartmentalization point of view, the risk of fire spread is also higher. This includes horizontal and vertical fire spread in the building, but also external fire spread to adjacent buildings (even in case there is no exposed timber on the facade).
