# Student

This is a brief starter pack to help students understand their roles in 41936.

## Your role
In the scenario of the course you are not 'playing a student' but instead you are a recently graduated professional, who has experience alongside the growing confidence to both make suggestions and ask relevant questions. As such the scenario is slightly in the future and we hope that you will also try and identify 'new ways of working', rather than relying on 'but this is how we've always done it'. In this course you will deliver a realistic, full‑building project in multidisciplinary teams. Success depends on collaboration, not just individual subject work.

* You are part of a [subject](/Subjects/index.md).
* Within your subject you are a member of a consulting [company](Company.md).

It is up to you to balance these requirements. 

1. [Integration](/Assignments/index.md)
2. [Project Requirements](/Project/index.md)
3. [Subject Requirements](/Subject.md)

```{hint}
Students often forget that there is an equal weighting between integration, project, and subject requirements
```
See [rubric](Assignments/Rubric.md) for more information on grading.

## Your progress through the course
The course progresses in 4 stages.
* **Stage A**: Analysis - A deep dive process to performing a forensice analysis of the existing building, exisitng proposed solutions, and modeling your own proposed building. It is also when you start setting up the softwares needed and centralising your model.
* **Stage B**: Options - The stage to have your models set up and centralized. It is about developing options, and obtaining preliminary feedback on your design.
* **Stage C**: Client - The stage to start developing and satisfying project and client requirements. It is expected that at this stage, it is still unfinished.
* **Stage D**: Details (in June) - The stage to start detailing, finalizing your project requirements, subject requirements and ensuring integration and collaboration is possible, and presenting your awesome solutions.

## Where to find everything
* Learn Course Content: any files that need to be uploaded will be on Learn. That includes Lectures, Literature, and software instalation guides.
* Github Course Website: All information on the project, subject and assignment requirements can be found here. Use it as your single source of truth.
  * The assignment descriptions can be found under [Assignments](/Assignments/index.md), and the detailed assignment descriptions for each subject can be found under  the respective [subjects](/Subjects.md)
* Teams Files:  Uploading weekly files, tracking KPIs, and BEATs
 ```{hint}
Tip: You can search through all github files in the search bar
```
### For Announcements:
* Learn for weekly/ larger announcements usually before class.
* Teams for quick announcements during class (eg from TAs)

## Softwares used in this course
* There are a lot of softwares used in this course, check out both [Tools](/Tools/index.md) and [Workflows](/Workflows/index.md) to find more information about set up, installation, and use cases.
```{Note}
This course isn't requiring that you use all the tools listed below or that you use Revit. 
If you're familiar with a different modelling software and are in agreement among your group, then its possible to use any. 
It's most important that all models uploaded to Speckle and can be exported into IFC.
``` 
* A brief overview of some of the tools used by all the different disciplines. 
     * BIM Modeling Softwares: Revit, Autocad, Archicad, Speckle, NavisWorks, Revizto, Enscape
     * Simulation/ Analysis Softwares: LCAByg, IDA ICE, BE18, Sigma Molio, Simapro, MS Project, Autodesk, Python
  
## Tips from previous students
* Take your team contract seriously and regularly check in. 
* Start modeling and sharing early. Bind early decisions
* Clarify what matters for the grading before the 3 weeks in June.
* Early collaboration both within your teams and on models is very important.
* Try and not to get bottlenecked in your progress by waiting for other disciplines.
