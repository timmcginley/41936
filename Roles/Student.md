# Student

This is a brief starter pack to help students understand their roles in 41936.

## Your role
In the scenario of the course you are not 'playing a student' but instead you are a recently graduated professional, who has experience alongside the growing confidence to both make suggestions and ask relevant questions. As such the scenario is slightly in the future and we hope that you will also try and identify 'new ways of working', rather than relying on 'but this is how we've always done it'. In this course you will deliver a realistic, full‑building project in multidisciplinary teams. Success depends on collaboration, not just individual subject work.

* You are part of a [subject](/Subject.md).
* Within your subject you are a member of a consulting [company](Company.md).

It is up to you to balance these requirements.
