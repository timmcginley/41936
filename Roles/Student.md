# Student

This is a brief starter pack to help students understand their roles in 41936.

## Your role
In the scenario of the course you are not 'playing a student' but instead you are a recently graduated professional, who has experience alongside the growing confidence to both make suggestions and ask relevant questions. As such the scenario is slightly in the future and we hope that you will also try and identify 'new ways of working', rather than relying on 'but this is how we've always done it'. In this course you will deliver a realistic, full‑building project in multidisciplinary teams. Success depends on collaboration, not just individual subject work.

* You are part of a [subject](/Subject.md).
* Within your subject you are a member of a consulting [company](Company.md).

It is up to you to balance these requirements.

1. [Integration](/Assignments/index.md)
2. [Project Requirements](/Project/index.md)
3. [Subject Requirements](/Subject.md)

```{hint}
Students often forget that there is an equal weighting between integration, project, and subject requirements
```

## Where to find everything
* Learn Course Content: any files that need to be uploaded will be on Learn. That includes Lectures, Literature, and software instalation guides.
* Github Course Website: All information on the project, subject and assignment requirements can be found here. Use it as your single source of truth.
* Teams Files:  Uploading weekly files, tracking KPIs, and BEATs
 ```{hint}
Tip: You can search through all github files in the search bar
```
For Announcements:
* Learn for weekly/ larger announcements usually before class.
* Teams for quick announcements during class (eg from TAs)
  
## Tips from previous students
* Take your team contract seriously and regularly check in. 
* Start modeling and sharing early. Bind early decisions
* Ask other teams for quick comparisons
* Clarify what matters for the grading before the 3 weeks in June.
* Collaboration both in the teams and on models is very important.
* Try and not to get bottlenecked in your progress by waiting for other disciplines.
