# Student

This is a brief set of guidelines to help students understand their roles in 41936.

## Your role

As such the scenario is slightly in the future and we hope that you will also try and idntify 'new ways of working', rather than relying on 'but this is how we've always done it'.

* You are part of a [subject](/Roles/Subject.md).
* Within your subject you are a member of a consulting [company](/Roles/Company.md).

It is up to you to balance these requirements.
