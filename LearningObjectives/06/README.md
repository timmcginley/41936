## 6. Achieve recognition of the need for developing alternative solutions and iterations in the design process 

### Input 
Technical requirements 
### Process 
Explore different strategies, tactics and solutions to  
### Output 
A selection of quantified design options that your design team can explore

The main feedback on this objective should come based on your 13-week report. This will also be considered in the 3 weeks so you may want to summarise different options, however in the 3 week you will also have to justify and defend your design decisions (LO8). It is possible that describing the different options in a way that leads to your final decisions perhaps by showing why the others didnâ€™t work is a good way to justify and defend your design decisions also. Feedback: formative - based on feedback from PART C report / summative based on PART D report.
