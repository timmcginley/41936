## 5. Integrate various technical requirements into a functional building design that satisfies the client brief

### Input 
Technical requirements 
### Process 
Integrateâ€¦. 
### Output 
a functional building design that satisfies the client brief 

Based on your analysis of the client brief in Learning Objective 2, you will integrate the technical requirements into a functional design that satisfies the client brief. How can you get formative (in progress) feedback on this? what questions could you ask your subject teachers and discuss with your peers? Are you interested in the integration of all the requirements into the final building design or is it more about identifying the requirements for the core and seek feedback on how your design addresses this. If you can stick to the theme weeks this should help and mean that you can also learn from your peers who will probably also be interested in that theme in that week.
