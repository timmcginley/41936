These are the 2 stages of the project. The outline design is completed at the end of the 13-week period (PART C). At the START of the 3 week period (PART D) you receive formative feedback to help you understand how you can improve your project and achieve your learning objectives. This formative (in progress) feedback will then help you to work on your PART D submission (preliminary design). You will then receive summative (final) feedback on the assessment of your project. It is very important that the assessors can see both that you submitted a strong outline design and that your improved on it for the preliminary design. Both your peers and the teachers spend a lot of time on the 13-week (PART C) feedback so make sure you take the opportunity to improve on this.
