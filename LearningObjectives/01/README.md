# 1. Collaborate with other disciplines
> Collaborate with diverse members of the design team to realise interdisciplinary design solutions based on systems engineering principles that balance and integrate their own disciplinary technical requirements with those of the team to the satisfaction of the project requirements.

In this course the aim is to provide you with a real-world design experience. In your studies so far, you may have focused on solving single disciplinary issues on your own. However, you will have also gained experience working in teams and know that sustainable solutions require input from different stakeholders. It is this experience that we want you to reflect on to help you learn about collaborating with other specialists in this course. Analysing the client requirements is a core part of the process. Without analysing their requirements through the client brief, you will not know what is expected of your design. The client’s job is not to tell you everything though. Some things you will have to work out what they want / need based on the requirements.
