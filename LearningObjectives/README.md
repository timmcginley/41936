1. Collaborate with diverse members 
Collaborate with diverse members of the design team to realise interdisciplinary design solutions based on systems engineering principles that balance and integrate their own disciplinary technical requirements with those of the team to the satisfaction of the project requirements.
1. Define, monitor and evaluate their project team’s values (KPIs) in a professional manner.
1. Evaluate the design models and reports from previous course cohorts to identify the challenges to balancing the project and disciplinary requirements in a complex building project.
1. Strategise, track and update a design management scheme (DMS) to support team coordination and collaboration based on analysis of the project requirements.
1. Develop, maintain and evaluate a digital benchmark building model (BBM) to assess design proposals throughout the project against analysis of the project requirements
1. Communicate and investigate the building design and analysis using models, drawings, reports, diagrams, dashboards and presentations to internal and or external assessors to a professional level.
1. Guide the building design team with technical subject reports based on disciplinary analysis to provide the scientific foundation for the 'higher level' guidance in the client report.
1. Actively support alternative interdisciplinary design solution options to support an integrated design process that provides meaningful choices to the client and design team.
1. Model and analyse digital OpenBIM building models using computational design and disciplinary analysis tools to provide realtime guidance to the whole team throughout the design process.
1. Make and justify your design decisions based on the project requirements, team needs and reflection on the client, disciplinary expert and peer feedback to improve the design throughout the design process.

## How is my learning aligned to the course activities? 
The best way to start any course is to ask what you are expected to learn from it. The course learning objectives are therefore provided below with a brief description of how you are expected to achieve each of the learning objectives. 

How do we do this? Well, we could start with these learning objectives. They could be thought of as test units that can be aligned to construct your learning for the course. What do we mean by this? Each learning objective has  
an input (something you can use to provide input to your learning) 

a process (we learn by doing (REF) therefore it is important to consider what you are doing to learn. – what work are you doing – this is the work you do to facilitate your learning – if you don’t do the work – you don’t learn J 

an output – we sometimes call this the product of your learning, but don’t consider how it can be reused to support other students learning.
