## How is my learning aligned to the course activities? 
The best way to start any course is to ask what you are expected to learn from it. The course learning objectives are therefore provided below with a brief description of how you are expected to achieve each of the learning objectives. 

How do we do this? Well, we could start with these learning objectives. They could be thought of as test units that can be aligned to construct your learning for the course. What do we mean by this? Each learning objective has  
an input (something you can use to provide input to your learning) 

a process (we learn by doing (REF) therefore it is important to consider what you are doing to learn. – what work are you doing – this is the work you do to facilitate your learning – if you don’t do the work – you don’t learn J 

an output – we sometimes call this the product of your learning, but don’t consider how it can be reused to support other students learning.
