## 10. Present the final design to the internal assessors 

### Input 
Your hard work for the course 
### Process 
Presentation, VR and Q+A 
### Output 
Feedback from the assessors 

This is an exciting part of the course, that you can read about elsewhere in this handbook. We conduct this also in VR and the assessors walk around the building and the subject specialists ask you the questions they have from your presentation. You will also provide a formal PowerPoint presentation and your reports will be available for us to review and ask questions on.
