# 3. Evaluate previous projects

> Evaluate the design models and reports from previous course cohorts to identify the challenges to balancing the project and disciplinary requirements in a complex building project.

We think it is really important to learn from previous work for two reasons. 
1. it helps us do better work.
2. we can't afford to not learn from previous work as there is such an urgency with the climate crisis. We need to learn how to design better, more sustainable buildings, now.
