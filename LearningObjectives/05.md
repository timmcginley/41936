# 5. Benchmark Building Model
> Develop, maintain and evaluate a digital benchmark building model (BBM) to assess design proposals throughout the project against analysis of the project requirements

The benchmark model is really important as it will enable you when combined wiht the BEATS to see the benefits and drawback of your approach and also the benefits and challenges of other teams approachess so we cna seee which combination of approaches are successful.

| Input | Process | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Previous models and reports, blank BBM, BEATS, Your assumptions and initial design idea.    | Use the BBM to work out thefeasibility of your building and explore different options early in the design process      | A completed BBM to test the feasibility of the design.    |
