## 2. Analyse a client's requirements

### Input 
The Client brief 
### Process 
Analyse the client’s needs 
### Output 
Produce tech requirements for your subject based on this.

This is a core part of the process. Without analysing the client requirements through the client brief, you will not know what is expected of your design. The client’s job is not to tell you everything though. Some things you will have to work out what they want / need based on the requirements.
