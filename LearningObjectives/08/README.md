## 8. Justify and defend design decisions 
> Actively support alternative interdisciplinary design solution options to support an integrated design process that provides meaningful choices to the client and design team.

The main feedback on this objective should come based on your 13-week report. This will also be considered in the 3 weeks so you may want to summarise different options, however in the 3 week you will also have to justify and defend your design decisions (LO8). It is possible that describing the different options in a way that leads to your final decisions perhaps by showing why the others didnâ€™t work is a good way to justify and defend your design decisions also. Feedback: formative - based on feedback from PART C report / summative based on PART D report.
