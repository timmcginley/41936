# Teaching Assistant

Teaching Assistants (TAs) play important role in supporting both teachers and students.

## Some key responsibilities towards teachers:
* assist with lecture coordination
* facilitate workshops and exercises
* help with evaluation of students' work
* convey feedbacks or questions from students
* subject-specific help

## Some key responsibilities towards students:
* be the first line of help for students on matters on organisation, subject, content, software
* able to construct feedback on their work
* facilitate early-stage of team's coordination problem solving

# Timeline:
* You are expected to be available from 13:00 to 17:00.
* 13:00 - 14:00 is a lecture time. So if you are assigned to a specific subject, please help teacher if one needs any support.
* Not everytime will be a lot of stuff to do. However, we in the course rely a lot on coordination between subjects, teacher and student teams. So sometimes it requires navigation between classes and organizing people where they need to be right now. We want the course running smoothly so everyone will feel like it works like a clockwork:)
