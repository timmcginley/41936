# Course Mentors

The course is mentored by industry representatives. They will select which teams they will mentor based on you performance in the first assignment.

There will be three different types of mentors representing the three common types of Architecture Engineering collaboration in building design that we see today.

# Mentor 1 - Engineers in the Architecture Office
Typically where a large Architecture practice has seen value in employing engineers to increase building design integration. Criteria: Architects and Engineers in the same building.

Examples of this would be BIG Engineering.

# Mentor 2 - Engineer Office in the same corporate group as Architecture Office
Typically where a large Engineering firm has seen value in 'buying' an Architecture practice.

Examples of this are Ramb√∏ll and Henning Larsen.

# Mentor 3 - Engineer and Architect only linked through the project.
This is the traditional context for architectural engineering collaboration. The Engineer and Architects are employed by seperate companies that are not part of the same group.
Examples of this would be Buro Happold and GXN.
