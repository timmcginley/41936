In this first activity you will be asked to make a 'guesstimate' of the GFA for your building.
* What **GFA** are you aiming at for your building?
This requires that you define the F2F height.
* Will you have a greater ceiling height on the ground floor?
* Will you have different types of floors for different parts of the building?
*
