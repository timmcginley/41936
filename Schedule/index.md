-->

### Activity
* Team formation
* Find subject
In this first activity you will be asked to make a 'guesstimate' of the GFA for your building.
* What **GFA** are you aiming at for your building?
This requires that you define the F2F height.
* Will you have a greater ceiling height on the ground floor?
* Will you have different types of floors for different parts of the building?

###  By the end of the session
* Enroll on DTU Learn in your team subject and consultant groups.
* Sign your team contract.
