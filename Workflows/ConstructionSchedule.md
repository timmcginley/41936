# Construction Schedule (simplified)

> The construction schedule is one of your roles as project managers PM/ICT and is also  part of DGNB as PRO5.5.1 

A construction schedule is a roadmap for your building renovation project. Its purpose is to:
* Determine the overall project completion time.
* Establish time frames for each activity to ensure the project stays on track.
* Coordinate efforts across the six disciplines.
* Identify potential delays and allocate resources effectively.
  
This skill is not only essential for your PM Consultant reports but also a fundamental competency in project management, widely applicable across industries.

### Below is a simple step by step guide to construction schedules
## 1. Identify Work Tasks
List all tasks required for the renovation, spanning the design and planning phases and construction activities. Break them down by discipline where applicable.
Design and Planning Phase:
* Architectural design and drawings.
* Structural assessments and engineering plans.
* MEP system design (e.g., HVAC, electrical layouts).
* Geotechnical analysis (e.g., soil testing).
* Material selection and procurement planning.

Construction Phase:
* Foundation work.
* Structural renovations or reinforcements.
* MEP installations.
* Architectural finishes (e.g., walls, flooring).
* Site cleanup and final inspections.

> Tip: Collaborate with all disciplines to ensure no tasks are overlooked

## 2. Determine Task Dependencies
Identify the sequence of tasks by noting dependencies; tasks that must be completed before others can begin. 
For example:
* Design and planning must be finalized before construction starts.
8 Foundation work precedes structural renovations.
* MEP installations follow structural completion but precede architectural finishes.
> Theory: This step aligns with the Critical Path Method (CPM), a widely-used technique in construction management that identifies the longest sequence of dependent tasks to determine the project’s minimum duration.

## 3. Estimate Time for Each Task
Assign a time estimate to each task in months, as specified. Base thes estimates on:
* Project Complexity: Larger or more intricate renovations take longer.
* Historical Data: Use past project records or industry benchmarks
* Expert Input: Consult team members from each discipline.

Example Time Estimates (in Months):
* Design and Planning: 2-3 months (varies by building size and scope).
* Geotechnical Work: 1 month (soil testing and foundation design).
* Foundation Work: 1-2 months.
* Structural Renovations: 3-4 months.
* MEP Installations: 2-3 months.
* Architectural Finishes: 2-3 months.
> Note: The example months and tasks demonstrated in this guide are not definitive. Be sure to conduct your own research based on your specific building to determine the appropriate list of tasks and the accurate number of months needed for your project.

> Theory: Time estimation is a key component of scheduling methodologies like CPM and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). PERT accounts for uncertainty by using three time estimates for each task:
* Optimistic (O): Best-case scenario.
* Most Likely (M): Most probable scenario.
* Pessimistic (P): Worst-case scenario.
* Expected time ( based on PERT Beta Distribution) can be calculated as:
 TE = (O + 4*M + P) / 6 

This formula provides a weighted average, balancing optimism and pessimism to create realistic estimates. Historical data from similar projects or industry benchmarks (e.g., PMI standards) can further refine estimates.

## 4. Choose a Consistent Unit of Time
Use months throughout the schedule, as required. This ensures clarity and uniformity in your PM Consultant reports.

## 5. Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
A WBS organizes tasks hierarchically, making the project manageable. It breaks the renovation into phases and sub-tasks.
Sample WBS:
* Level 1: Building Renovation Project
  * Level 2: Design and Planning
       * Architectural Design (2 months)  etc….
  * Level 2: Construction
       * Foundation Work (1.5 months)
       * Structural Renovations (3 months) etc…

> Theory: The WBS is a foundational tool in project management enabling task assignment and progress tracking.

## 6. Develop a Gantt Chart
A Gantt chart visually represents the schedule, showing:
* Task start and end dates.
* Durations (in months).
* Dependencies (e.g., arrows linking tasks).

Sample Gantt Chart Example:

* Month 1-3: Design and Planning.
* Month 4-5: Foundation Work (starts after design).
  
> Tools: Use software like Microsoft Project, Excel, or free online platforms (e.g., TeamGantt) to create this.
<hr>
## 7. Include Buffer Time
Add buffer months (e.g., 1-2 months) to account for:
Unexpected delays (e.g., weather, supply chain issues).
Additional tasks not initially identified.
