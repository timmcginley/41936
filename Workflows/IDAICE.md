# IDA ICE

IDA ICE (Indoor Climate and Energy) is a high-fidelity simulation tool developed by EQUA Simulation AB for the detailed study of building performance. It utilizes a powerful equation-based engine to accurately model a building's thermal indoor climate, energy consumption, and complex HVAC systems.

Four key points about the software:

* **Dynamic Multi-Zone and Plant Simulation:** Detailed, multi-zone whole-year simulation of temperatures, indoor quality and energy use, integrated with advanced HVAC and plant modeling.
* **Transparency:** Unlike other commercial simulation tools, IDA ICE allows users to browse the underlying equations and log thousands of run-time variables for full transparency.
* **Advanced BIM Integration:** The software supports IFC import, allowing for efficient workflow from design to simulation.
* **Equation-Based Flexibility:** Built on the Neutral Model Format (NMF, similar to Modelica language), it enables expert users to create and customize their own component models for specialized research.

Do parametric studies on individual thermal zones.
For whole-building simulation:
- Use provided resources on IFC import to IDA ICE
- Simplify multi-zone simulations: merge similar zones, merge windows, avoid openings between zones, separate floors into separate IDA files, use templates to define basic input across similar zones
