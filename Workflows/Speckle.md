# Speckle based workflow
This guide will help you understand how to integrate Speckle into your workflow, making your design and engineering processes more connected, flexible, and efficient. 

## 🚀 Why Use Speckle? 
Speckle helps you: 
* Collaborate across disciplines – Work with others using Revit, Rhino, 
Grasshopper, Archicad, and more 
* Visualise your designs in the browser – No installs needed to explore geometry and data 
* Track design changes – See how your models evolve and compare versions visually 
* Enable real-time design feedback – Comment and review directly inside your project’s 3D space 
* Simplify coordination – Combine models from multiple disciplines in one unified viewer 
* Prepare for industry workflows – Learn modern, open-source, cloud-based practices used by leading AEC firms 
 
All inside your DTU Workspace at app.speckle.systems 

## Getting Started with Speckle
For DTU Students – 2025 Edition

### 1. Create a Speckle Account
* visit [https://app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems)
* Sign up using your @dtu.dk or @student.dtu.dk email address. 
* You’ve been automatically invited to join the **DTU Workspace**. Check your email and accept the invitation to collaborate with classmates and access shared content. 

### 2. Install a Connector
* After signing in, go to the **Connectors** tab in the Speckle Web App. 
* Download and install the connector for your software (e.g.,** Revit, Rhino, Grasshopper**, etc.)

```{info}
Speckle Manager is deprecated. All connectors are now installed directly from the web app
```
### 3. Create a Project and Model 
* From your Speckle Web App dashboard, click **New Project** 
* Name your project ABD-[YEAR]-[TEAM]-[STAGE] (e.g., "ABD-25-10-C")
* Within your project, create one or more **Models**. For example: 
     * "Arch" 
     * "Str" 
     * "MEP"
  
### 4. How Multi-Disciplinary Teams Work on One Project in Speckle: 
* Invite team members by email and assign them roles: 
     * **Owner** – Full control over the project 
     * **Editor** – Can publish data and manage models. 
     * **Viewer** – Can view models and leave comments.
       
💡 In the **DTU Workspace**, all students can view each other’s projects by default; this is useful for peer review and collaborative learning. 

### 5. Publish from Design Tools 
#### Example: Publish from Revit 
1.	Open Revit and launch the Speckle connector (found in the Add-ins tab) 
2.	Choose the correct **Project** and **Model** from the list. 
3.	Select the elements you want to include 
4.	Click **Publish** – this creates a new **version** in your model 
##### Example: Load into Rhino 
1.	Open Rhino and launch the Speckle connector 
2.	Choose the same Project and Model. 
3.	Select the version you wish to load 
4.	Click **Load** – your model will appear in Rhino.
   
You’ve now successfully sent and received data between two tools using Speckle. 
### 6. Viewing the Combined Model in Speckle Web 
* Open your **Project** and select a **Model** in the Web App.
* Use tools in the 3D viewer to: 
     * Toggle visibility of multiple models 
     * Compare versions and track design development. 
     * Add comments or feedback in context. 
 
<!-- ### 3. Set Up a Speckle Stream
A "Stream" in Speckle is like a shared project where you send and receive data.
* Open your Speckle Web App and create a new stream.
* Name it (e.g., “My Revit to Rhino Project”) and save it.
* Copy the Stream URL—you’ll use it to send data from your software.
* Send Data from Revit (or Other Software)

Let’s say you want to send a Revit model to Rhino :
* Open Revit and go to the Speckle Connector (found in the Add-ins tab).
* Select the stream you created earlier.
* Choose the elements or the entire model to send.
* Click "Send"—Speckle will upload your data to the cloud.

Receive Data in Rhino (or another tool)
* Open Rhino and launch the Speckle Connector (from the toolbar or command line).
* Select the same stream from your Speckle account.
* Click "Receive"—your Revit model will now appear in Rhino!

Now you’ve successfully transferred data between Revit and Rhino using Speckle
## How multi-disciplinary Teams Work on One Project in Speckle:
### 1) Set Up a Shared Speckle Stream for the Project
A **Speckle Stream** acts as a central repository where each discipline contributes their model data. Follow these steps to collaborate efficiently with your team.
* Open the **Speckle Web App**.
* Click **"Create a New Stream"** (e.g., "Mixed-Use Tower Project").
* Share the stream with all team members (architects, structural engineers, MEP designers).
* Assign roles
Now, every discipline can send and receive data without overwriting each other’s work.

### 2) Sending and Receiving Data per Discipline
Each team works in their own software and **sends updates to the shared Speckle stream.**
Now, all models are stored separately but visible together in the Speckle web viewer.

### 3) Viewing the Combined Model in Speckle Web
      1) Go to the **Speckle Web App** and open the shared project stream.
       2) Turn on/off different layers (Architectural, Structural, MEP).
       3) Use the **"Compare Versions"** tool to track updates from each discipline.
       4) Add **comments** for feedback directly in the 3D viewer.
This allows all teams to see the entire project without needing Revit, Rhino, or Tekla.
