# Learning Objectives
How is my learning aligned to the course activities? 
The best way to start any course is to ask what you are expected to learn from it. The course learning objectives are therefore provided below with a brief description of how you are expected to achieve each of the learning objectives. 

How do we do this? Well, we could start with these learning objectives. They could be thought of as test units that can be aligned to construct your learning for the course. What do we mean by this? Each learning objective has  
an input (something you can use to provide input to your learning) 

a process (we learn by doing (REF) therefore it is important to consider what you are doing to learn. – what work are you doing – this is the work you do to facilitate your learning – if you don’t do the work – you don’t learn J 

an output – we sometimes call this the product of your learning, but don’t consider how it can be reused to support other students learning. 

## 1. Collaborate with other specialists 

### Input 
Get information need from other stakeholders 
### Process 
Solve information need informed as defined in the DMS / ICT contract 
### Output 
Provide Guidance to other stakeholders 
 
In this course the aim is to provide you with a real-world design experience. In your studies so far, you may have focused on solving single disciplinary issues on your own. However, you will have also gained experience working in teams and know that sustainable solutions require input from different stakeholders. It is this experience that we want you to reflect on to help you learn about collaborating with other specialists in this course.

## 2. Analyse a client's requirements

### Input 
The Client brief 
### Process 
Analyse the client’s needs 
### Output 
Produce tech requirements for your subject based on this.

This is a core part of the process. Without analysing the client requirements through the client brief, you will not know what is expected of your design. The client’s job is not to tell you everything though. Some things you will have to work out what they want / need based on the requirements. 

## 3. Participate in develop a design management scheme to enable the project team to work together towards common goals and deadlines 

### Input 
Technical requirements, client brief, ICT contract? 
### Process 
Identify and synthesise the activities into a Design Management Scheme 
### Output 
Design Management Scheme

This is important, the DMS helps you to progress the design. The Design Management Scheme is synthesised by the project managers, but it is important that the whole team collaborate on it. 

## 4. Create digital building models by using building information modelling 

### Input 
Technical requirements 
### Process 
Design and modelling 
### Output 
BIM models, both native and IFC 

BIM is a core component of the course, in the worst case it can be ‘left to the end’. The intention of the course is that you use BIM to support the design process. So, to support this, you will be asked to produce specific aspects of your building in BIM based on the weekly themes. Furthermore the PART C and PART D assignments also have specific subject BIM requirements. The client has asked that you keep the BIM updated on teams so that they can keep an eye on your progress. Furthermore, the complete BIM model will be used to drive the VR presentation to internal assessors at the end of the course to assess the primary product of the course - the final building - however it is also useful to enable formative (in progress) feedback to you, from your teachers and peers. The submission of the BIM should be in native and IFC format. Although through a link to 41934 we encourage the use of Open BIM tools, many teams groups choose to use Revit although, other tools are available, it is important to define what you will be using early in the project, and that you have access to the tools you will need. The best case is if this is on your own laptop to give you the most flexibility in how and when you collaborate with your colleagues (L01). 

## 5. Integrate various technical requirements into a functional building design that satisfies the client brief

### Input 
Technical requirements 
### Process 
Integrate…. 
### Output 
a functional building design that satisfies the client brief 

Based on your analysis of the client brief in Learning Objective 2, you will integrate the technical requirements into a functional design that satisfies the client brief. How can you get formative (in progress) feedback on this? what questions could you ask your subject teachers and discuss with your peers? Are you interested in the integration of all the requirements into the final building design or is it more about identifying the requirements for the core and seek feedback on how your design addresses this. If you can stick to the theme weeks this should help and mean that you can also learn from your peers who will probably also be interested in that theme in that week. 

## 6. Achieve recognition of the need for developing alternative solutions and iterations in the design process 

### Input 
Technical requirements 
### Process 
Explore different strategies, tactics and solutions to  
### Output 
A selection of quantified design options that your design team can explore

The main feedback on this objective should come based on your 13-week report. This will also be considered in the 3 weeks so you may want to summarise different options, however in the 3 week you will also have to justify and defend your design decisions (LO8). It is possible that describing the different options in a way that leads to your final decisions perhaps by showing why the others didn’t work is a good way to justify and defend your design decisions also. Feedback: formative - based on feedback from PART C report / summative based on PART D report. 

## 7. Produce technical reports documenting the fulfilment of specific functional requirements such as indoor climate, energy performance, structural performance, fire and safety performance, acoustic performance and constructability 

### Input 
Design
### Process 
Analyse project  
### Output 
Technical report 

This a skill that is important to develop, you are not only doing the engineering and getting the results but learning how to communicate those results. The different subject and client reports all have their own challenges in this.

## 8. Justify and defend design decisions 

### Input 
Design
### Process 
Analyse project  
### Output 
Technical report 

Please refer to the discussion for LO6. 

Feedback: At the beginning of PART D, you receive both peer and teacher feedback on your reports.

## 9. Develop an outline design and preliminary design 

### Input 
Requirements and feedback 
### Process 
Reflection and design 
### Output 
Outline and  

These are the 2 stages of the project. The outline design is completed at the end of the 13-week period (PART C). At the START of the 3 week period (PART D) you receive formative feedback to help you understand how you can improve your project and achieve your learning objectives. This formative (in progress) feedback will then help you to work on your PART D submission (preliminary design). You will then receive summative (final) feedback on the assessment of your project. It is very important that the assessors can see both that you submitted a strong outline design and that your improved on it for the preliminary design. Both your peers and the teachers spend a lot of time on the 13-week (PART C) feedback so make sure you take the opportunity to improve on this. 

## 10. Present the final design to the internal assessors 

### Input 
Your hard work for the course 
### Process 
Presentation, VR and Q+A 
### Output 
Feedback from the assessors 

This is an exciting part of the course, that you can read about elsewhere in this handbook. We conduct this also in VR and the assessors walk around the building and the subject specialists ask you the questions they have from your presentation. You will also provide a formal PowerPoint presentation and your reports will be available for us to review and ask questions on. 

## 11. Achieve knowledge about systems engineering 

### Input 
Your experience of the process 
### Process 
Considering this experience from a system engineering perspective 
### Output 
Understanding of the design process from a system engineering perspective 

This requirement relies on the DMS produced in LO3 being a ‘living’ document that positively contributes to the planning and execution of tasks in the team. Beyond this you should take this final learning objective as an opportunity to look more deeply into the design process you are experiencing in 41936 and start to think about how this could be improved from a system engineering perspective. Furthermore, this objective should encourage us to consider if we would be prepared to share our data for the project so that it could be analysed in future versions of 41934 to help build new tools to support the next generation of advanced building designers!
