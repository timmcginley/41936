# Project KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
In this first session of the course you will be introduced to your teachers and meet with the other members of your subject. You will be asked to divide into groups and to consider what is important for your subject group / company.  

In week 1 of the project, the PMs set their KPIs to describe the values of the team, the other subjects can then bid to be part of these teams based on the values. In your subjects you will be expected to make subject specific decisions that support the stated (KPI) values of your team. 

## DGNB / Sustainability 

DTU wants B313 to achieve a DGNB certification at minimum DGNB ‘Lite’ Gold level. Please see the seperate DGNB Lite schema for details, that contains a reduced set of criteria for you to achieve each week. We have reduced the criteria and adjusted the points so that LCA for instance gains greater importance. To make this easier Kristoffer Negendahl has written an LCA lite excel sheet to help in your calculations. The ‘level’ must be decided by your PM as either: 

DGNB “Lite” - silver, gold or platinum 

## COST 

The cost level is decided by your PM in balance with sustainability goals and especially time budget. Refer to the PM subject document for what to include in costs. The construction budget depends on the resulting gross area and must be either:  

25.000DKK/m2, 30.000DKK/m2 or 35.000DKK/m2 

## TIME 

The time budget is also flexible, and defined by the PM. The durations (incl. design proposal period) to choose between are respectively: 

30 months, 35 months or 40 months 

## USER 

This describes the spatial efficiency of the building. This calculation is focused on the heated areas of the building. We will ask you to provide the GFA/person for the non-heated area too, but not as a KPI. The reason for this is, that in this course we need the below ground for the geotechnical subject but, in a real project it is not possible to include the lower floors and still hit the KPI targets here - so we will not ask you to do it, but please consider this in future projects! 

15 GFA/person, 18 GFA/person or 20 GFA/person 

# Points allocation

|        | 1 pts | 3 pts | 5 pts |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| Time   | 25 months | 30 months | 35 months |
| Cost   | 20k dkk/m2 | 25k dkk/m2| 30k dkk/m2 |
| DGNB (Lite)   | Platinum | Gold | Silver |
| People | 15 desks/m2       | 18 desks m2  | 20  desks/m2   |

In the session (PM Only): If you are in PM decide on the KPI values and make a describe these in the form. Each team has a number of points depending on how many points they got from their team selection and has to choose how to spend them on KPIs. These are explained in more detail on the previous page and their values are summarised here. For example, if we wanted to do a small expensive sustainable building quickly we could choose:
> 30 months (1 point) + 35.000DKK/M2 (3 pt) + platinum (1 point) + 15 people (3 point) = 8 Points
