# Grading Criteria

## 1/3 Integration (BIM):
We assess how well you've organized the spaces according to specifications, including accessibility by foot, bicycle, light rail, taxi, and car. We evaluate access to spaces on each floor and between floors in various scenarios: regular use, maintenance tasks, during events, and in emergencies such as fire. Additionally, we look at how effectively you've integrated different technical disciplines in the basement, shafts, ground floor, and office floors. Your adherence to BIM model requirements, including entities and LOD, is also considered.

## 1/3 Fulfilling Client Requirements (BIM and Client Report):
We evaluate how well you've met the client's requirements and your team's KPIs.

## 1/3 Subject/Technical (Subject Reports):
We assess how well you've met the requirements outlined in the subject reports.

# Authorship:

## For BIM: 
Please provide information about the modellers. It's essential to specify if individuals from one subject group or students from other subject groups have assisted.

## For Client and Subject Reports: 
Pages without author(s) will not be considered. This requirement aligns with DTU's regulations. If one subject assists another in tasks and contributes sections to their report, those individuals should be identified as authors. If assistance is provided by someone from a different subject group (e.g., Subject 1 assisting Subject 2), it should be mentioned in Subject 1's report that assistance was given to Subject 2 to ensure proper credit is given.
