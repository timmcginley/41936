## Course overview 
The course has around 100 students each year with different disciplinary backgrounds. The students choose a subject and then submit a tender to become part of a team. There are 1-2 students per subject (group) and 7 subject groups per building team. 

> ‘knowledge is constructed through the activities of the learner’ ​(Biggs, 2014)​ 

This course supports the construction of your knowledge and skills in the collaborative design and development of a high rise building through activities that are aligned to support you to achieve the course learning objectives. Motivating activities have been carefully developed over the last 14 year period to inspire you in this course. The aim of this document is to explain the course and project and how the activities are aligned to the learning objectives. This course is designed to give the greatest opportunity to arrive at a design that is integrated between the subjects, whilst addressing the client requirements. However, this also requires a lot of work from you. The course expectations have been clearly articulated to support you to synthesise the feedback you will receive during the course. In this way we hope to support your learning and ultimately construct your knowledge and expertise in advanced building design! 

the course is supported by some factors to help us gamify the advnaced building design process.

## [KPIs](KPIs/README.md)
This is the engine of the course. These can be combined with other figures to provide an overview on the progress of the teams.

## [DGNB LITE](/Tools/DGNBLite/README.md)
This year we are continuing the experiment to introduce DGNB [add ref] into the course. ~~Your PM will choose what level your team is aiming at and then different criteria and associated points will be available to you each week.~~

## [BEATS](BEATS/README.md)

Furthermore, we are continuing with the beats - the idea with the beats is that they can provide you and members of your team and peers with a quick numeric overview of your project. This will also help us to track the projects and flag those that mind need help.
