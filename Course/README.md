# Course overview 

## Part
This course has around 100 students each year with different disciplinary backgrounds. The students choose a subject and then submit a tender to become part of a team. There are 1-2 students per subject (group) and 7 subject groups per building team. 

> ‘knowledge is constructed through the activities of the learner’ ​(Biggs, 2014)​ 

This course supports the construction of your knowledge and skills in the collaborative design and development of a high rise building through activities that are aligned to support you to achieve the course learning objectives. Motivating activities have been carefully developed over the last 14 year period to inspire you in this course. 

This course is designed to give the greatest opportunity to arrive at a design that is integrated between the subjects, whilst addressing the client requirements. However, this also requires a lot of work from you. The course expectations have been clearly articulated to support you to synthesise the feedback you will receive during the course. In this way we hope to support your learning and ultimately construct your knowledge and expertise in advanced building design! 

We use the following concepts in the advancced building design process.

* [KPIs](KPIs/README.md)
* [DGNB](/Tools/DGNB/README.md) Alignment
* [BEATS](BEATS/README.md)



Furthermore, we are continuing with the beats - the idea with the beats is that they can provide you and members of your team and peers with a quick numeric overview of your project. This will also help us to track the projects and flag those that mind need help.
