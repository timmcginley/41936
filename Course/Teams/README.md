## Team Creation

In real projects the company you are representing will have to bid to become part of the building team.

ISO 19650 provides guidance on how to best support the tendering and information delivery in projects. A simplified interpretation of that process is applied in this course. This means your subject group will act as a company consulting to the client through the PM group for your team. To consult you need to be clear about the service you offer and the price of this service.  

In our case the client (A) will employ the PM (B) who will then employ the rest of the team (C). 

Based on this we can see that B (PM) has a different role to A and in the case of this course they get to make decisions about the KPI ambition of the team, which others can then address. 

Therefore, in this course you will bid to join a subject, your bid will also determine your cost on the project. 

More details are provided in week 1 lecture.
