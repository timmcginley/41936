# B1: # of permanent workspaces in building

This value is important for the client in making a business case for renting the building â€“ and for you to design the building. At least 90% of the permanent workspaces should meet the minimum daylight requirements in the Danish Building Code. A lot of design choices depend on the number of persons in the building; fire measures (evacuation time, width of stairs), canteen size, number of toilets, size of ventilation etc. Based on the user density of 15, 18 or 20 GFA/person, we expect the building to have at least 1.875, 1.575 or 1.425 permanents workspaces, where at least 90% has sufficient daylight. However, if you add more permanent workspaces it will add to a positive business case for the Client.

*In addition you should have 300 student workspaces. This value is a measure of the flexibility for the building in taking in students. This should be in a well-designed area with focus on acoustics, group work etc. There are no formal daylight requirements for the student, except that the entire area must have access to daylight.*
