# BEATS 
## 1: Gross floor area (total above ground) 
The purpose of this beat is to help you to consider the impact of the size of the core and its relationship to the rest of the building. Shafts / cores are included. They are a vital part of the design and need to be designed efficiently, therefore they are part of the GFA. The reception area, hallways, auditorium, Skybar and study area etc. are also part of the GFA. Only the basement is not included. 
## 5: Building Volume 
What is the volume of your building? We like this value because it means you have at least calculated the footprint and height and if you have complex shape(s) maybe you have calculated it more accurately? 
## 2: Cost 
This is the total (estimated cost of the project). See PM subject for what is included and what is omitted. 
## 3: Hours 
This is the total design hours spent on the project (including PM - it should be updated by PM for the whole team, every week. 
## 4: Footprint area 
What is the footprint area of your building, are you using all the available space or leaving some for green space for instance? 
## 6: # of floors above ground 
We want you to consider the number of floors in the building. This is both to think about how you can increase the amount of rentable space in the building, but also so that we can be clear how you are addressing issues such as floor to floor height, for instance. 
## 7: # of floors below ground 
How many floors do you have below ground? 
## 8: F2F height 
Like the other beats presented here this is very much linked into the other beats, for instance the # of floors. To guide you the f2f (floor to floor) dimension should be between 3.6 to 3.8m in a typical floor. 
## 9: F2F Ground floor 
This may be different from the other floors. 
## 10: # of car park spaces 
## 11: Min height in office space 
You can think of this value as being there to help you consider the minimum quality of space that you are offering in your building. If you are not sure what it should be, go and visit offices and measure the floor to ceiling height. What feels comfortable to you? This should be investigated in collaboration between architecture and MEP. A benchmark for you is between 2.7 to 3.0m. 
## 12: # of permanent workspaces in building 
This value is important for the client in making a business case for renting the building – and for you to design the building. At least 90% of the permanent workspaces should meet the minimum daylight requirements in the Danish Building Code. A lot of design choices depend on the number of persons in the building; fire measures (evacuation time, width of stairs), canteen size, number of toilets, size of ventilation etc. Based on the user density of 15, 18 or 20 GFA/person, we expect the building to have at least 1.875, 1.575 or 1.425 permanents workspaces, where at least 90% has sufficient daylight. However, if you add more permanent workspaces it will add to a positive business case for the Client. 
## 13: Free 
This beat is currently free, it will be filled soon 
## 14: # of permanent workspaces in student areas 
This value is a measure of the flexibility for the building in taking in students. We expect to have around 300 student workspaces. This should be in a well-designed area with focus on acoustics, group work etc. There are no formal daylight requirements for the student, except that the entire area must have access to daylight.  
## 15: Average Façade Transparency 
Evaluated as a total for facades with workstations behind them. Ratio of transparent façade versus total façade. 
## 16: Energy resilience 
The building must be energy resilient in the sense that thermal comfort does not suffer too much, if heating and cooling systems are shut down during peak periods. The beat should document how fast the indoor temperature reaches the threshold on a warm day (setpoint - 2C) and on a cold day (setpoint + 2C). 
## 17: CO2 
The consumption + embedded CO2 over the life span of the building (kgCO2/m2/year). The use design requirement of the building project is 50 years. In construction this is a coming requirement in the Danish building code. 
## 18: Core Vs Usable Space Ratio 
Ratio of total m2 used for cores versus total m2 gross floor area above ground. 
## 19: Horizontal Deflection 
Horizontal deflection in top of the building. 
## 20: Absolute top of building 
We can easily fool ourselves into thinking that the top of the final slab is the top of the building, this is rarely the case, it is important to talk with MEP early on and establish what this is, especially if you are intending to go towards the height limit.
