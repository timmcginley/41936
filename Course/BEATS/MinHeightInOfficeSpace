# B3 Min height in office space

You can think of this value as being there to help you consider the minimum quality of space that you are offering in your building. If you are not sure what it should be, go and visit offices and measure the floor to ceiling height. What feels comfortable to you? This should be investigated in collaboration between architecture and MEP. A benchmark for you is between 2.7 to 3.0m.
