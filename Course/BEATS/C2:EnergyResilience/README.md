# C2: Energy resilience

The building must be energy resilient in the sense that thermal comfort does not suffer too much, if heating and cooling systems are shut down during peak periods. The beat should document how fast the indoor temperature reaches the threshold on a warm day (setpoint - 2C) and on a cold day (setpoint + 2C).
