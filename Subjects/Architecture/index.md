**Building design requires respectful collaboration between different design and engineering disciplines. Architectural Consultants need to design a building that provides the function required by the client, that is greater than the sum of its parts. To do this the focus on the design of the [spaces], [facades] and [finishes] and communication of the design.** 

Architectural consultants need to get their heads into the project quickly and start exploring the potential form (3D shape) and spatial arrangement of the building to support the investigations of the other subjects. If this initial work is done well, it will provide you with a valuable perspective on the building design process. Check teh integration examples below for more information. Whilst you may have your 'own' ideas for the building you will find that you will need to be explore many alternative design solutions to synthesise the needs of all the consultants of the team.

## Assignments
This provides advice for what the Architecture subject is responsible for, this needs to be integrated into the overall requirements of each assignment.
### Part A
Identify the parts of the project and the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for the structures group for all periods of the project (A,B,C and D) and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be coordinated by your PM group.

#### A1 Physical model
* Support the analysis, design and construction of the physical model.
* Use the model to explore the spatial capacity and requirements of your team's chosen building
* Explore different options for facade design
* Work with Geo consultants (if you haev them) to model the site that the building sits on.

## Requirements
Advanced Building Design requires the collaborative design, modelling, analysis, communication and iteration of interdisciplinary solutions to each building system at every stage of the design process. specifically this means the responsibilities and dependencies for architecture are:

### Client Requirements
* Synthesise the client requirements into aesthetic and functional SPACES.

### Design Concept
* Develop, synthesis and communicate the architectural design concept(s) to the satisfaction of the design team and the client.

### BR18
* Check BR18 conformance.

### Iterate
* Model different design options for FACADE, BUILDING ENVELOPE, AUDITORIUM and others,to guide and facilitate analysis and feedback from the team.

### Spatial Relationships
* Define the relationships between the SPACES required by the client.

### Building Mass
* Define and iterate the mass (form) of the building envelope.

### Circulation and Accessability
* Define access to and egress from the BUILDING

### Acoustic Analysis of the spaces
* Perform acoustic analysis of the SPACES.

### Facade Design
* Design and iterate the FACADE based on the space requirements and input from MEP from concept through to detail design.

### An integrated building design
* it should be a welcoming and inclusive building
* why would people go to the building - how does it seem interesting / inviting?
* Is it a landmark building and to what extent does it try and blend into the surroundings? How do we know it is a DTU building but also something new? What statement is it making?
* Consider the different elements of the building and how they are combined to support the subject and project requirements.

### More than the sum of its parts
Consider the different elements of the building and how they are combined to support the subject and project requirements.

### Sense of place
Consider how your building creates a sense of place. How are you â€˜treatingâ€™ the surrounding area. Have you considered the landscaping around the building? is there a hard separation between the inside and outside? If so, is this required?

### Architectural Concept
Clear concept for the building - what is it the architecture is trying to achieve - does you building effect how people feel? if so how and is this what you intended? One definition is that architecture either supports truth or narrative: if truth it should focus on expressing its real purpose, if narrative it should tell you a story that inspires you to think in a certain way.

### Design Process
get this back from the manual!!!

### Strategies and tactics
As Architects with an engineerâ€™s curiosity to test, you should separate your strategies (your idea) for your tactics (the realisation of the idea), so you know which to change as you iterate. These should be testable against the client and technical requirements where possible (learning Objective 5. Integrate various technical requirements into a functional building design that satisfies the client brief.)

### Keep it simple
Both the architectural ideas and your presentation of them should be expressed simply, always.

### Building Envelope
The architectural mass, sometimes called the form (or more simply the shape) should be considered and explored early in iterations, decisions on this effect all disciplines. You should consider both the architectural and engineering mass of the building.

### Circulation
Design, analyse and communicate how to navigate the building considering:
* how to enter the building from outside (pedestrian, bicycle and car), from the parking area.
* Universal Design principles.
* Circulation through the building, how is this communicated to the users?
* How do people move around and between floors, how do they know where to go?
* The design should embrace the principles of Universal Design. It is
important to explore how to achieve maximum usability through the design
of spaces, use of light and choice of materials.

### Spaces
* Spatial hierarchy: Consider the hierarchy of the spaces including size of corridors, lobbies,informal and formal meeting and working spaces. Consider the spaces required to support the â€˜heroâ€™ spaces of the building.
* Use of public spaces / consider separation of public and private spaces.

### Facade Design
Design the facade considering:
- How it signifies the function of the building,
- The materials, texture and design,
- Windows on other openings
- Wall construction with vapour barrier, insulation, secondary
construction, wind barrier and cladding
- the sun shading system
- the rhythm that that it creates on the elevation
- the window cleaning system etc.

### Structure
Consider the integration of all the architectural elements with the structure. Columns can organize space - use them.

### Open design process
We are not prescribing the design process, this is up to you as architects to explore a process that supports the needs of your team. If you are not sure what their needs are you should ask. We will use 3D modelling to explore ideas and BIM concepts to support collaboration, but you should also make physical sketch models for instance to explore the potential of your building. These do not need to be â€˜productionâ€™ level models but can be valuable aids to thinking about the building. Explore the building in plan and section. This shouldnâ€™t be an afterthought but treated as a powerful method to explore spaces.

### Try it!
Embrace both the in and out of control elements of the process. If in doubt - start and try it, and then try it again ðŸ˜Š

### Think abstract
Where possible think in abstractions - its faster ðŸ˜Š Try and sketch out ideas
to explore the implications.

## Universal Design

The original Universal Design Principles can be found [here](https://design.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/principles-of-universal-design.pdf) and [here](https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/the-7-principles/)

These have then be reframed for buildings in this [work](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/5f96c774d9001d01f079dfd0)

Mosca, E.I., Capolongo, S. (2020). Universal Design-Based Framework to Assess Usability and Inclusion of Buildings. In: Gervasi, O., et al. Computational Science and Its Applications â€“ ICCSA 2020. ICCSA 2020. Lecture Notes in Computer Science(), vol 12253. Springer, Cham. https://doi-org.proxy.findit.cvt.dk/10.1007/978-3-030-58814-4_22

### Physical-Spatial Quality
*The capability of the environment to foster easy, comfortable, functional, and safe use of space and objects. This means being able to physically interact with a system;*

#### Principle 1: Usability: 
To use environments, facilities, and objects to ensure the comfort of different users (e.g. distance, dimension, weight, number of people, etc.). Usability includes accessibility, which is considered a pre-requisite;
  
#### Principle 2: Functionality: 
To satisfy the preferences of different users through flexibility and adaptation of space and furniture in terms of use and time (i.e. maintainability);

#### Principle 3: Safety/Security: 
To guarantee safety and security of different users in both emergency and common situations, by minimizing risks without stigmatized solutions;

### Sensorial-Cognitive Quality
*The capability of the environment to foster orientation, comprehension of the service, and comfort of users. This refers to the features that impact peoplesâ€™ senses and cognition;*

#### Principle 4: Wayfinding: 
To orientate users with visual, tactile, and verbal information to help them determine their own position in a space;

#### Principle 5: Understanding: 
To communicate information in an effective and simple way through different methods, regardless of the environmental conditions or the cognitive and sensory abilities of users;

### Social Quality
*The ability of the environment to enhance well-being and inclusion. It considers emotional stimuli and social integration among users.*

#### Principle 6: Well-being: 
To transfer positive emotions to different users through healthy behaviours, physical activity and the design of the environment and its soft qualities, pleasantness, and esthetics;

#### Principle 7: Social Inclusion: 
To foster active participation of different users during the design process, guarantee the same experience for all users, reinforce the cultural values of any design project, and treat all groups with dignity and respect.

## Interdisciplinarity
### Architecture -> Structure
The relationship between structures and architecture is very important and
needs to be strong. You can use this to explore ideas about what each subject
should model. For instance, one approach for the floors is for the architects
to model the finished floor and for the structures group to model the
structural slab. This should avoid potential clashes in the federated BIM
(model/s).

### Architecture -> MEP
The relationship to building services is really important to architecture,
for instance, the location of the plant rooms and the routes of larger
ventilation ducting that may be too noisy for space requirements such as
meeting rooms.

### Architecture -> PM / ICT
The integration to the ICT/PM group is really important. A symbiotic
relationship between the two subjects can help improve the quality,
communication and frequency of early design decisions.
