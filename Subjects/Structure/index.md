*The main role of structural engineers within civil engineering is the design of structures such as buildings, bridges and industrial facilities. In an ideal case structural engineers develop the initial design in partnership with architects.*

Today, the use of mathematical and numerical models of the structure to calculate the stresses that could arise from different load scenarios is common practice. In connection with the design of high-rise buildings the structural engineer needs to consider particular loading effects and service functions such as high local wind suction on façade elements, deflection due to wind and earthquake load, motion, occupant comfort to horizontal acceleration, internal stiffening system with integrated transportation systems and evacuation ways and vibration damping systems if required. Particularly in connection to wind effects and airflow around the building base the pedestrian wind comfort becomes an additional aspect concerning the overall architectural concept of the building shape, function and its close environment.

## Assignments
## Part A
### Plan and Team Contract
Identify the parts of the project and the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for
the structures group for the 13 and 3 week period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner
to be coordinated by your PM group.
Identified parts that will help structure the work which will create the schedule,could be static
system, material, loads, combinations, element sizes, connections, design calculations, drawings etc.

## Part B

### B Drawings
Drawings required to be integrated into the interdisciplinary drawings:
- Plan sketch of horizontal stabilising elements.
-	Plan sketch of vertical loaded elements.
-	Sketch of any specific and important special structure.
-	A structural detail dealing with some important connection.

## Part C

### C BIM
You should be developing the BIM model through the course. This might not be possible in the early stages, however, start as soon as possible when some elements are certain. To give you a guide you should expect to have a model that we can do a quantity take off from by week 10. The structural system of the entire building, basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire core should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines. The elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof.

### C Consultant Report
After the PREVIOUS milestone you can now start calculating in more details the forces and dimensions of your structure. Use the methods you are most familiar with. We can give some supervision to FE-modelling but if you have no experience with this method use proper hand-calculations; the Empire State Building was designed long before the computer era! At the end of the 13 weeks you should have a clear idea about your structure, loads and dimensions, detailing and the integration of special architectural features if any. Before you finish the 13-week period your project should be at a point that you have no questions left regarding finalizing the design in the 3 weeks period. You will get comments on the report you have to prepare at the end of the 13 weeks, which should clear up last details.

Following aspects and issues should be addressed in the report (deliverables):
1. Development of building concept.
2. Choice of static system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates).
3. Choice of material (pure concrete, steel-concrete composite, pure or partial steel structure).
4. Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, fire and overall wind loads).
5. First verification of overall structural stability and foundation pressure.
6. Dimensions of the element profiles and sectional forces on slabs, beams, columns and core.

## Part D 
### D BIM
The structural system of the entire building including slabs, beams, columns and core. Also conceptual input to basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire core, the elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof and basement, should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines, Stairs in the core.

### D Consultant Report
The report on Subject 2 shall be delivered in electronic form as one pdf-file, containing all calculation approaches, brief method descriptions, calculation results and drawing material. The report should be clearly
and concisely written in English. The report will be evaluated on the basis of:
1. Clarity and depth of understanding shown by the description of the chosen design, structural system,
response calculation and organization of building function.
2. Logic, accuracy and completeness of the performed design calculations.
3. Presentation and analysis of the results.

The overall and detailed structural design can be documented with:
- CAD-Drawings and
- Clear and accurate sketches - electronic or by hand.

The **Part D Subject report** is a continuation of the **Part C report**. The **Part D Subject report** report includes details, more drawings, and more appendices including calculations. You can see it as a detailed design report. The **Part C report** contains more principles and estimates of element dimension, considerations of details. It is a concept design report.

## Integration

### Structures -> Architecture

Spaces, materials, architecture e.g.
- Do you have the spaces that the designer wishes, also after you have inserted all your columns etc.
- Agree with the designer what kind of materials you should use, so you have sustainable materials with a good aesthetic look, but still have the required strength and stiffness.
- Is it in general possible to solve the architectural ideas in a good and healthy static system, or do you, as a structural engineer, need to adjust the initial architectural design to get a better structural system.

The work in subject Structure will initially be in close cooperation with Subject Architecture where the main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; floor plans (including space for technical installations), design of windows, floor height, ventilation concept, heating and cooling system (especially if building integrated solutions are used), and thermal mass. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible

### Structures -> MEP

Façade daylight, installation sizes and collisions of ducts with columns or beams, thermal bridges e.g.
- Does your façade solutions, including columns and beams in facade, provide enough daylight into the building? Sometimes beams in the façade prevent high windows and therefore good daylight
- Do the structural elements create thermal bridges through the insulated building envelope?
- Do you have space for all installations, vertical and horizontal? Have you optimized the required space not to spend client’s money unwisely? Do any installation have to go through structural components, and is that a structural problem? When ducts and pipes branch out from the vertical shaft on every floor, the shaft is often significantly weakened.

### Structures -> Geotech
Max allowable forces to foundation, global bending moment of building e.g. 
* Discuss with the geotechnical subject if the soil and the foundation system in general can be designed to handle the reaction from the high-rise. 
* Do you have tension from the high-rise, or do you only have compression. Tension can give a lot more challenges for the geotechnical subject to handle. 
* How do you deal with the spring stiffness that the soil supports the high-rise. 

### Structures -> Material
Depending on the choice of materials, the structural behaviour should be considered and analysed. As a structural engineer you should have a strong opinion of the best material for structural safety and comfort. However, architectural opinions and sustainable solution etc would be important collaborative driver for the project. 

### Structures -> PM/ICT

BIM model should fit with structural models e.g.
- Structural choices have huge impact on the overall cost of the project. Please discuss this and agree if this fits in the overall economy budget for the project.
- You should create the structural BIM Model and coordinate it with the entire BIM model. And check if there are any clash with installation, fire protection, foundation and the architectural concept in general.
- There should be similarity between the BIM model the structural choices and structural calculations.
- Be aware of the waste management system you chose, to remove the waste from the building and coordinate the height of the basement accordingly. Is it from –1 Level, removed by a waste management truck, that results in a higher floor to floor for –1 Level than for –2 Level and –3 Level. This results in the access ramp to be either inside or outside the excavation/retaining system area, therefore, coordination of these has to be between Structural Engineer, Architect, MEP, and PM.
