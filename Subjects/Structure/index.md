*The main role of structural engineers within civil engineering is the design of structures such as buildings, bridges and industrial facilities. In an ideal case structural engineers develop the initial design in partnership with architects.*

Today, the use of mathematical and numerical models of the structure to calculate the stresses that could arise from different load scenarios is common practice. In connection with the design of high-rise buildings the structural engineer needs to consider particular loading effects and service functions such as high local wind suction on façade elements, deflection due to wind and earthquake load, motion, occupant comfort to horizontal acceleration, internal stiffening system with integrated transportation systems and evacuation ways and vibration damping systems if required. Particularly in connection to wind effects and airflow around the building base the pedestrian wind comfort becomes an additional aspect concerning the overall architectural concept of the building shape, function and its close environment.

## Assignments
## Part A
### Plan and Team Contract
Identify the parts of the project and the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for
the structures group for the 13 and 3 week period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner
to be coordinated by your PM group. Develop proposals for how the structural system can be established in the transformed building.
Identified parts that will help structure the work which will create the schedule,could be stuctural
system, material, loads, combinations, members  sizes, connections, design calculations, drawings etc.

## Part B

### B Drawings
Drawings required to be integrated into the interdisciplinary drawings:
- Plan sketch of horizontal stabilising memebers.
-	Plan sketch of vertical loaded members.
-	Sketch of any specific and important special structure.
-	A structural detail dealing with some important connection.

## Part C

### C BIM
You should be developing the BIM model through the course. This might not be possible in the early stages, however, start as soon as possible when some elements are certain. To give you a guide you should expect to have a model that we can do a quantity take off from by week 10. This quanitity take off should be cooriidnated across subjects. The structural system of the entire building, basement structure should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines. For each structural member, indicate whether it is existing, modified, or new.

### C Client Report

Contribute to the client report with a description of the overall structural system of the transformed building, including the materials used, and assess the potential for reuse and reinforcement of existing structural members.


### C Consultant Report
After the PREVIOUS milestone you can now start calculating in more details the forces and dimensions of your structure. Use the methods you are most familiar with. We can give some supervision to FE-modelling but if you have no experience with this method use proper hand-calculations; the Empire State Building was designed long before the computer era! At the end of the 13 weeks you should have a clear idea about your structure, loads and dimensions, detailing and the integration of special architectural features if any. Before you finish the 13-week period your project should be at a point that you have no questions left regarding finalizing the design in the 3 weeks period. You will get comments on the report you have to prepare at the end of the 13 weeks, which should clear up last details.

Following aspects and issues should be addressed in the report (deliverables):
1. Development of building concept.
2. Choice of structural system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates).
3. Choice of material (pure concrete, steel-concrete composite, pure or partial steel structure, timber).
4. Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, fire and overall wind loads).
5. First verification of overall structural stability and foundation pressure.
6. Dimensions of the element profiles and sectional forces on structural elements.

## Part D 
### D BIM
The structural system of the entire building including slabs, beams, columns and walls. Also conceptual input to basement structure be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines. For each structural member, indicate whether it is existing, modified, or new.

### D Client Report

Contribute to the final client report by describing the final overall structural system of the transformed building and the materials used. Specify to what extent the existing structural members have been reused and reinforced.

### D Consultant Report
The report on Subject 2 shall be delivered in electronic form as one pdf-file, containing all calculation approaches, brief method descriptions, calculation results and drawing material. The report should be clearly
and concisely written in English. The report will be evaluated on the basis of:
1. Clarity and depth of understanding shown by the description of the chosen design, structural system,
response calculation and organization of building function.
2. Logic, accuracy and completeness of the performed design calculations.
3. Presentation and analysis of the results.

The overall and detailed structural design can be documented with:
- CAD-Drawings and
- Clear and accurate sketches - electronic or by hand.

The **Part D Subject report** is a continuation of the **Part C report**. The **Part D Subject report** report includes details, more drawings, and more appendices including calculations. You can see it as a detailed design report. The **Part C report** contains more principles and estimates of element dimension, considerations of details. It is a concept design report.

## Integration

### Structures -> Architecture

Spaces, materials, architecture e.g.
- Do you have the spaces that the designer wishes, also after you have inserted all your columns etc.
- Agree with the designer what kind of materials you should use, so you have sustainable materials with a good aesthetic look, but still have the required strength and stiffness.
- Is it in general possible to solve the architectural ideas in a good and healthy structural system, or do you, as a structural engineer, need to adjust the initial architectural design to get a better structural system.

The work in subject Structure will initially be in close cooperation with Subject Architecture where the main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; floor plans (including space for technical installations), design of windows, floor height, ventilation concept, heating and cooling system (especially if building integrated solutions are used), and thermal mass. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible

### Structures -> MEP

Façade daylight, installation sizes and collisions of ducts with columns or beams, thermal bridges e.g.
- Does your façade solutions, including columns and beams in facade, provide enough daylight into the building? Sometimes beams in the façade prevent high windows and therefore good daylight
- Do the structural elements create thermal bridges through the insulated building envelope?
- Do you have space for all installations, vertical and horizontal? Have you optimized the required space not to spend client’s money unwisely? Do any installation have to go through structural components, and is that a structural problem? When ducts and pipes branch out from the vertical shaft on every floor, the shaft is often significantly weakened.

### Structures -> Geotech
Max allowable forces to foundation, global bending moment of building e.g. 
* Discuss with the geotechnical subject if the soil and the foundation system in general.

### Structures -> Material
Depending on the choice of materials, the structural behaviour should be considered and analysed. As a structural engineer you should have a strong opinion of the best material for structural safety and comfort. However, architectural opinions and sustainable solution etc would be important collaborative driver for the project. 

### Structures -> PM/ICT

BIM model should fit with structural models e.g.
- Structural choices have huge impact on the overall cost of the project. Please discuss this and agree if this fits in the overall economy budget for the project.
- You should create the structural BIM Model and coordinate it with the entire BIM model. And check if there are any clash with installation, fire protection, foundation and the architectural concept in general.
- There should be similarity between the BIM model the structural choices and structural calculations.
