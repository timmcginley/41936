# STR Requirements

Besides the below, there will be more specific Structural Requirements included in one of the first teaching sessions.

## Basic requirements

### Building Concept
Development of building concept, including:
- Choice of static system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates).
- Choice of material (concrete, steel, composite, etc).
- Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, wind loads).

### Structural quality
The structural quality should ensure lifetimes of 50-100 years for all essential building elements used in the building structure, facades, windows, etc.

### Refined Design
Refinement of preliminary design, only detailing (beams, columns, slabs, core) with respect to ventilation, floor area arrangement (individual offices, open plan office landscape, aisles, recreation areas), and façade connection to main structure.

### Load Combinations
Partial safety factors for different combinations and decisive load cases for overall and local structural design.

### Structural Members
Detail Design of structural members.

### Dynamic Properties
Establish dynamic properties.

### Building Motion
Assessment of building motion at top floors due to wind loading.

### Buildability
Easily buildable solutions are preferred. The construction period should be as short as possible.

### Promote maintenance friendly solutions
Robust and maintenance-friendly solutions should be used throughout the building.

### Facade
Concept design of the connection between the primary load carrying system and the secondary facade load carrying system.

### Detailed requirements

* Description of structural system/ static system including connections and stability. Including supports. Including basement.
* Description of robustness
* Choice of materials
* Load collection
* Load combinations (3-5)
* Max. section forces in main elements.
* Detailed design of the most critical main element of the columns, beams, slabs, core. Inclusive reduction of capacity for stability.
    * It is accepted to use suppliers table for HCS, SL deck, pre stressed concrete element beams etc. but the method of choosing the elements should be showed.
    * If you use any kind of steel profile you should verify the design by hand calculation.
    * In-situ structures (beams, columns, slabs, core) should be designed.
    * Columns should be verified inclusive stability (2nd order effect for concrete columns).
* Principle design of basement structures as beams, columns slabs. However, if these structures are part of the foundation solution and take forces as a result of that this design should be solved with geotechnical forces in mind.
* Construct and draw main details or principle connections (min. 5) (beam/slab/column, beam/slab, core/beam, core/slab, slab/facade etc.)
* Horizontal SLS deformations from wind in top of building. Even by hand (finding moment of inertia) or by FEM. 1/500xh.
* Plan, elevation, section drawings
* Interface description to other subjects (forces to geotechnical, space for installations, collaboration with architects etc.)
* Natural frequency of building and corresponding
horizontal modeshapes . Is the wind dynamic critical, and how can you then reduce the accelerations.
* Concept design for structural integration of special structures (inclined
columns, cantilever parts, atrium, auditorium, double height columns etc )).
* Description of BIM model
* Description of construction methods .
* Initial Structural fire design of critical beam, colum and slab only for concrete
* Geotechnical concept description

### Optional work
Minimum 2 additional tasks required for 3 person group, and 3 for 4 persons group:
* Extensive FEM modeling for more exact results
* Axial shortening of columns (creep, shrinkage, elastic)
* Wind comfort: Check if wind induced horizontal acceleration of building are within the limits according to Eurocode
* Detailed calculation of steel composite beams
* Detailed calculation of joints.
* Detailed calculation of complex joints where stiffness could be relevant.
* Detailed analysis of special structures (inclined columns, cantilevered parts, atrium, auditorium etc
* Detailed analysis of pre stressed concrete element beam
* Detailed façade solutions
* Shear lag effects (in tubed systems)
* Shear deformations. Any deformations which reduces the stiffness of the system form the ideal cantilevered model. The so called “cantilever efficiency"
*  Geometric non linear calculations including p delta effects
* Floor comfort : Check if vertical accelerations in floor systems are within the limits of Eurocode.
* Detiled structural fire design calculations
* Detailed Geotechnical stability analysis
* Etc
