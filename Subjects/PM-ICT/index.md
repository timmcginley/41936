**The project manager in 2025 is management with a small m. The aim of the course is to support the whole design team to collaborate and gain confidence in their design decisions. The role of PM is therfore to:**
* Define their professional values and build a team that reflects these
* Remove barriers to collaboration and
* Align information processes in the team and support OpenBIM tools processes and standards
* Ensure project deliverables are created and submitted on time
* Apply and reflect on different strategies to support their team
* Track the KPIs and Design Management Scheme to guide and encourage their team
* Clearly communicate and adapt their style of management to balance the needs of the team and the project.
* Respond to requests and any changes communicated to them in writing by the client at any point in the project.

According to “Description of Services for Building and Landscape 2018”: 2.2 ICT management -  In respect of agreed digital design work, the ICT manager is responsible for coordinating any digital cooperation between the consultants, design contractors, the client and any authorities together with the design manager. The digital design cooperation is organized based on the ICT specification of the consultancy agreement. If no ICT specification has been prepared, the ICT manager will organize the digital cooperation together with the consultants.

## Requirements 

### Integrated, supportive and high functioning team
The PM consultants need to check that work has been done and is properly submitted. If the client sees that work is missing or incorrect, this can delay payment to the whole team. Normally this delay is one month. In this case each consultant will have to pay for a loan to cover their internal costs. So it is important that you stay on top of this.

### On budget
The proposed scheme must be within the budgetary framework including all parts of the building + operational cost + design cost.

### On time
The proposed scheme must be within the time frame.

### Sustainable
The proposed scheme must meet the target DGNB class.

### Well managed
The design project must be well managed.

### Promote BIM and digital tools
Teams should make use of digital tools and create a BIM Building Information Model.

## Interdisciplinary PM/ICT

### PM/ICT -> Architecture
The integration between the ICT/PM and architecture group is really important. A symbiotic relationship between the two subjects can help improve the quality, communication and timely design decisions. Both subjects have shared role in space planning - Architecture with the visible and ICT/PM with the hidden spaces in the building.
- Create the BIM Model template together with the Architect and share it for the entire team to use the same for all subject models
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Coordinate waste management system applied in the building

### PM/ICT -> Structures
- Spatial coordination and choice of structural system
- Location of stiffening system
- Stimulate coordination with Architecture,MEP, Geotech, and Fire
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities

### PM/ICT -> MEP
- Spatial coordination
- Location of shafts
- Routing of pipes and ducts
- Stimulate coordination with Architecture and Structures
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities

### PM/ICT -> Geotech 
- Location and size of excavation
- Spatial coordination of foundations
- Stimulate coordination with Structural
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities

### PM/ICT -> Fire Safety
- Location and size of stair and lifts for firefighters
- Spatial coordination of egress routes
- Stimulate coordination with Architecture, Structural, and MEP
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities for passive and active fire protection systems
- Maintenance and operation costs for fire protections systems 

### PM/ICT -> Materials 
- Assist “Materials” in quantity take-off
- Continuously make access to Quantities/BIM models
- Classification/types of materials
