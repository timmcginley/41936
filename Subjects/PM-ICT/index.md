Chief Consultant: Jan Karlshøj

**The aim of the course is to support the whole design team to collaborate and gain confidence in innovating, design decisions. The role of PM is therfore to:**
* Define their professional values and build a team that reflects these
* Remove barriers to collaboration
* Ensure communication and compromise amongst disciplines as 1/3 of the assessment is integration
* Align information processes in the team and support OpenBIM tools processes and standards
* Ensure project deliverables are created and submitted on time
* Apply and reflect on different strategies to support their team
* Track the KPIs to guide and encourage their team
* Clearly communicate and adapt their style of management to balance the needs of the team and the project.
* Respond to requests and any changes communicated to them in writing by the client at any point in the project.

According to “Description of Services for Building and Landscape 2018”: *2.2 ICT management -  In respect of agreed digital design work, the ICT manager is responsible for coordinating any digital cooperation between the consultants, design contractors, the client and any authorities together with the design manager. The digital design cooperation is organized based on the ICT specification of the consultancy agreement. If no ICT specification has been prepared, the ICT manager will organize the digital cooperation together with the consultants.*

## Requirements 

### Integrated, supportive and high functioning team
The PM consultants need to check that work has been done and is properly submitted. If the client sees that work is missing or incorrect, this can delay payment to the whole team. Normally this delay is one month. In this case each consultant will have to pay for a loan to cover their internal costs. So it is important that you stay on top of this.

### On budget
The proposed scheme must be within the budgetary framework including all parts of the building + operational cost + design cost.

### On time
The proposed design scheme must be within the time frame.

### Sustainable
The proposed scheme must meet the target DGNB class.

### Well managed
The design project must be well managed.

### Promote BIM and digital tools
Teams should make use of digital tools and create a BIM Building Information Model.

### DGNB

Teams should ensure that the DGNB criteria's are satisfied based on their chosen KPI.

## Integration

### PM/ICT -> Architecture/Fire
The integration between the ICT/PM and architecture group is really important. A symbiotic relationship between the two subjects can help improve the quality, communication and timely design decisions. Both subjects have shared role in space planning - Architecture with the visible and ICT/PM with the hidden spaces in the building.
- Create the BIM Model template together with the Architect and share it for the entire team to use the same for all subject models
- Spatial Cooridination
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities

### PM/ICT -> Structures
- Spatial coordination of the structural system
- Stimulate coordination with Architecture,MEP, Geotech, and Fire
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities

### PM/ICT -> MEP
- Spatial coordination
- Location of shafts
- Routing of pipes and ducts
- Stimulate coordination with Architecture and Structures
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities

### PM/ICT -> Geotech 
- Location and size of excavation
- Spatial coordination of foundations
- Stimulate coordination with Structural
- Stimulate sustainable considerations
- Continuously exchange BIM models
- Quantities

### PM/ICT -> Materials 
- Assist “Materials” in quantity take-off
- Assist in satifsying the DGNB criteria
- Continuously make access to Quantities/BIM models
- Classification/types of materials

## Assignments

<!-- you were here  -->

### Part A
Each subject group has to identify the parts of the project, the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for themselves and a as for the team for the Part A and Part D period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be collectively coordinated by your PM group.

#### Design Management Plan
The design management plsn has to be created to define your strategy for accomplishing the requirements set for the 13-week and the 3 week period for the whole team. To satisfy learning objectives 03 and 02. Note that these are general learning objectives that apply to all subjects and whilst it is your ‘responsibility’ in PM to deliver and submit the design management plan, you should encourage the other subjects to support you in this. The design management plan should:

1. Identify milestones and main tasks in the design of the project, their order and mutual dependencies
2.	Define the methods used to ensure spatial coordination, vertically and horizontally in the design of the building, inside and outside of the building.
3.	Identify major components that should be coordinated
4.	Describe the methods for selecting the ICT tools to be used e.g. why you choose one tools instead of another, when you use it, how you use it, who is involved, how do you ensure projects development tracking using these tools and processes. 
5.	The team contract must be coordinated and created by the PM, as a formal document to which all team members bind to. It has to be signed by all team members and uploaded as a separate PDF file but together with the 4 week plan in the same zip file.


### Part B
Make sure that the team develops integrated drawings, including alternative solutions. Capture input from teachers' comments and decide, together with the team, on your recommendation for the solution that your team is suggesting.

#### Subject Drawings
In Part B, present the following drawings:
1.	Selected IT tools for simulation/analysis and BIM-modelling
2.	How and when information are exchanged inside the team
3.	Coordinated schedule of activities for the entire team in the 13-week period
How the team will meet client requirements


### Part C
#### C Client report
Status on cost estimate. Status on DGNB Light score. Status on coordination issues. Present the existing situation, solved issues, not solved etc. The PM must facilitate the development of a coherent client report that presents a sustainable and safe building according to the client’s needs and budget.

#### C Consultant Report
Contents:

* Project schedules for the entire team. 3-week schedule (Part D) and the achieved observations during the process.
* Explain how the project was managed. Present how you used the schedule, tools, system engineering, KPI’s, beats to develop the project. Explain how you took action within the team, during the design meetings, how you overviewed or acted as a mediator when design criteria and client requirements were decided.
* Document the methods used to ensure traceability between requirements and implemented solutions. Present how you implemented and achieved the client requirements. Hint: Present the integration or requirements, work performed in the context of applied system engineering to your project and specifications.
* Document the spatial coordination between subjects, including sketches/drawings/renderings. Special attention should be given to:
* Allocation of spaces in shafts
* Coordination between building services and the structural system
* Coordination between the structural system and foundation
* Elements in the facades.
* Cost estimated
* DGNB light score
* To be included in the cost estimate:
    * Excavation
    * All materials related to the building
    * All services related to erecting the building
    * Cost of design. There’s been a bit of confusion about whether to include design costs in the total building cost. For this case, it’s optional — so you can decide whether to include them or leave them out.
    * Rent or lease of equipment used during construction
    * Overhead related to managing the erection of the building
* Maintenance for 10 years (without inflation) should be calculated but should not be included in the allowed budget limit.
    * Cleaning of the building and site for 10 years (site: lawn, façade: windows, inside: core, office space, meetings room, bar etc.)
    * Supply (water, electricity, heat, cooling, gas)
    * Waste (‘solid waste’, sewage)
* Should NOT be included in the estimate:
    * Furniture
    * Cost of site
    * Building permit
    * Lawyers
    * VAT

Include the ICT/PM [Contract] - ICT Contract which has to be presented in the appendices. Refer to it in the section of the report where you think is valuable.

Document how the interfaces between the subjects were coordinated (BCF can be used). Talk about the BIM model, present information about its advancement, how many issues initially, did you solve them as a team?
* Suggest improvements to BIM process in the Part D period.
* Explain how the project will be managed in the Part D period.

#### C BIM
The BIM Model must include spaces and should in general aim to be at Dikon LOD 300. Your responsibility is to coordinate the BIM models to benefit your building team. The submission at this stage may not be entirely clash-free or undergo full quality assurance, but it should represent progress towards quantity take-off for cost calculations. However, your ultimate goal should be to deliver a coordinated model by the end of the course. The BIM Model information must comply with the ICT Contract rules.

### Part D
The Part D reports are a development of the previous reports. This is true for all subjects.

#### D Client report
Contains the final:
* Final cost estimates.
* DGNB light score.
* Explain how the building is used during its operation—for example, how waste is removed and how goods are delivered, including equipment brought into multipurpose spaces.
* Describe how access is provided to key elements required for operation and maintenance tasks, such as window cleaning or changing filters in the ventilation system.

#### D Subject Report
* Document the general spatial coordination and detailed coordination on two different storeys.
* Include the revised ICT contract.
* Include reports from the ICT tool used to identify clashes and explain why they have not been solved.
* Include the original and revised project schedules and explain any differences between them.
* Document traceability between requirements, the implemented solutions and the process that led to the solution.
* Document how the interfaces between the subjects were coordinated. Use of BCF is the preferred solution.
* Explain how coordination issues were documented and solved during the project, and how it could have been improved.
* Explain how the project was managed during the course and what have been improved.
* Explain how the review and quality assurance processes were performed.

#### D BIM
Your responsibility is to coordinate the BIM models to the benefit of your building team. This includes clash detection and quality assurance and cost calculations. The team project BIM Model should be corelated, have the same coordinates for all subjects, have as less as possible coordination issues (e.g., clashes, misplaced objects, duplicated objects etc.). Use the VR session as a team, to ensure you find these issues, and together with the clash detection analysis you will conduct, will result in a good overall BIM Management. The BIM Model information must correspond entirely to the ICT Contract rules. For this assignment an overall increase in the quality and coordination has to be seen from the 13-week period. Your Model has to be a in a ready to build stage. Moreover, this will be analysed during the final presentation and assessment of the teamwork.

As a general rule for all subjects: The entire building has to be design at information Dikon LOD 300 and one floor (suggested to detail all subject elements on that specific floor) has to be LOD 325.
