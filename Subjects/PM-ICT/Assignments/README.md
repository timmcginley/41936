# PM/ICT Assignments
## Part A
Each subject group has to identify the parts of the project, the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for themselves and a as for the team for the **Part A** and **Part D** period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be collectively coordinated by your PM group.

The design management scheme (DMS) (e.g. an activities-Gantt chart) has to be created to define your strategy for accomplishing the requirements set for the 13-week and the 3 week period for the whole team. To satisfy learning objectives 03 and 02. Note that these are general learning objectives that apply to all subjects and whilst it is your ‘responsibility’ in PM to deliver and submit the DMS, you should encourage the other subjects to support you in this. The design management scheme (DMS) should:
1.	Identify milestones and main tasks in the design of the project, their order and mutual dependencies (e.g., Design Structure Matrix), according to the course-specific view on System Engineering
2.	Define the methods used to ensure spatial coordination, vertically and horizontally in the design of the building, inside and outside of the building.
3.	Identify major components that should be coordinated
4.	Describe the methods for selecting the ICT tools to be used e.g. why you choose one tools instead of another, when you use it, how you use it, who is involved, how do you ensure projects development tracking using these tools and processes.
The team contract must be coordinated and created by the PM, as a formal document to which all team members bind to. It has to be signed by all team members and uploaded as a separate PDF file but together with the 4 week plan in the same zip file. 

## Part B
### Subject Drawings
In Part B, present the following drawings:
1.	Selected IT tools for simulation/analysis and BIM-modelling, present a process-map, WBS (Work breakdown structure) overview
2.	Coordinated schedule of activities for the entire team in the 13-week period
3.	Allocated space for building services and structural elements, location of shafts and routing of building services elements. Explain integration of building services as well as structural and architectural elements.
4.	Client requirements coordinated with the system engineering process

## Part C
### Client report
Status on cost estimate.
Status on DGNB Light score.
Status on coordination issues. Present the existing situation, solved issues, not solved etc.
The PM must facilitate the development of a coherent client report that presents a sustainable and safe building according to the client’s needs and budget.

### Subject Report
Contents
- Project schedules for the entire team. The 7 week schedule (until Part B), 3-week schedule (Part D) and the achieved observations during the process.
- Explain how the project was managed. Present how you used the schedule, tools, system engineering, KPI’s, beats to develop the project. Explain how you took action within the team, during the design meetings, how you overviewed or acted as a mediator when design criteria and client requirements were decided.
- Document the methods used to ensure traceability between requirements and implemented solutions. Present how you implemented and achieved the client requirements. Hint: Present the integration or requirements, work performed in the context of applied system engineering to your project and specifications.
- Document the spatial coordination between subjects, including sketches/drawings/renderings. Special attention should be given to:
1.	Allocation of spaces in shafts
2.	Coordination between building services and the structural system
3.	Coordination between the structural system and foundation
4.	Elements in the facades.
- Cost estimated
- DGNB light score
- ICT-Contract

To be included in the cost estimate:
- Excavation
- All materials related to the building
- All services related to erecting the building
- Cost of design
- Rent or lease of equipment used during construction
- Overhead related to managing the erection of the building
- Maintenance for 10 years
- Cleaning of the building and site for 10 years (site: lawn, façade: windows, inside: core, office space, meetings room, bar etc.)
- Supply (water, electricity, heat, cooling, gas)
- Waste ('solid waste', sewage)
Should not be included in the estimate:
- Furniture
- Cost of site
- Building permit
- Lawyers
- VAT

Including the ICT/PM [Contract] - ICT Contract which has to be presented in the appendices. Refer to it in the section of the report where you think is valuable.
- Document how the interfaces between the subjects were coordinated (BCF can be used). Talk about the BIM model, present information about its advancement, how many issues initially, did you solve them as a team?
- Suggest improvements to BIM process in the **Part D** period.
- Explain how the project will be managed in the **Part D** period.

### BIM
Your responsibility is to coordinate the BIM models to the benefit of your building team. This includes clash detection and quality assurance and cost calculations. The team project BIM Model should be corelated, have the same coordinates for all subjects, have as less as possible coordination issues (e.g., clashes, misplaced objects, duplicated objects etc.). Use the VR session as a team, to ensure you find these issues, and together with the clash detection analysis you will conduct, will result in a good overall BIM Management. The BIM Model information must correspond entirely to the ICT Contract rules.

Note: Start checking the BIM Models as soon as possible, step by step e.g., as soon as you have information from a subject, check it in VR or analysing the clashes. 

## Part D
The 3 week period reports are a development of the previous 13 week reports. This is true for all subjects. 
### Client report
The final:
- Final cost estimates.
- DGNB light score.
- Explain how the building is used during operation.
- Explain how access to key elements for operation and maintenance tasks elements.

### Subject Report
Document the general spatial coordination and detailed coordination on two different storeys. 
- Include the revised ICT contract.
- Include reports from the ICT tool used to identify clashes and explain why they have not been solved.
- Include the original and revised project schedules and explain any differences between them.
- Document traceability between requirements, the implemented solutions and the process that led to the solution.
- Document how the interfaces between the subjects were coordinated. Use of BCF is the preferred solution.
- Explain how coordination issues were documented and solved during the project, and how it could have been improved.
- Explain how the project was managed during the course and what have been improved.
- Explain how the review and quality assurance processes were performed.


### Subject Report
This is a continuation on the 13 week report but with more detail on the
themes discussed in the course. This report describes the work done to develop
a preliminary design (LO9).
- collaborate with the other specialists (LO1)
- integrate the different requirements into your architectural design (LO5)
- explore alternatives (LO6)
- justify and defend your design decisions (LO8)
  
### BIM
Your responsibility is to coordinate the BIM models to the benefit of your building team. This includes clash detection and quality assurance and cost calculations. The team project BIM Model should be corelated, have the same coordinates for all subjects, have as less as possible coordination issues (e.g., clashes, misplaced objects, duplicated objects etc.). Use the VR session as a team, to ensure you find these issues, and together with the clash detection analysis you will conduct, will result in a good overall BIM Management. The BIM Model information must correspond entirely to the ICT Contract rules. For this assignment an overall increase in the quality and coordination has to be seen from the 13-week period. Your Model has to be a in a ready to build stage. Moreover, this will be analysed during the final presentation and assessment of the teamwork.

As a general rule for all subjects: The entire building has to be design at information level 3 and one floor (suggested to detail all subject elements on that specific floor) has to be information level 4. That means (LOD, LOI, LOG, LOA/LOR).

LOD specifications
What to include:
- **Architecture:**	Facade, entrance, ground floor and reception area with furniture and all the pieces, office floor, copy room, toilets, gym, lockers, auditoriums, sky bar, cafeteria, restaurant, bike parking, car parking (represent by adding only some elements (car, bikes) not all)
- **Structures**	The structural system, Basement structure, access to the basement, stairs in the core
- **MEP**	Choose 1 floor level from the above-detailed ones and add all your HVAC components. Create volume delimitation (boxes with names on it –ask PM/ICT for the explanation if needed) in the basement technical floor representing space division for the components. Vertical Inlet and Outlet ventilation from the basement to the top of the building based on your design criteria have to be included (is it continuous or not).
  
Note	All subjects are required to model having interoperability/coordination as a first rule
If other subjects need help, help your team members.
