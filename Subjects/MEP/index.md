*The subject concerns building services and building energy has the purpose of ensuring that the building has low energy consumption and acceptable indoor climate concerning both thermal and atmospheric air quality as well as day lighting conditions.*

In the MEP subject, the work is to establish the technical design parameters of the building. This comprises both passive and active design strategies which is to be implemented in concepts for heating, cooling and ventilation. Therefore, MEP Subject will work with room dimensions, daylight, façade design, ventilation type, heating and cooling supply, thermal simulations. One specific issue is to develop a system which will work in a high-rise building, which means that location of technical floors (mainly ventilation), pressure zones and space needed for the supply must be considered. The work in the subject requires – at least in the early phases – a large amount of coordination and integration with mainly subject 1, but also subject 2 and 5 are very important partners. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible.

## Assignments
# MEP Assignments
## Part A
### Plan and Team Contract
Identify the parts of the project and the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for the MEP group for the 13 and 3 week period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be coordinated by your PM group. The main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; initial space management for technical rooms/floors, shafts. The concept for heating, cooling and ventilation. Input to design of windows, floor height, and thermal mass.
Consider the following points to help you in planning the activities schedule.
1.	Detail the **success criteria** (energy class, daylight factors, indoor climate category (I, II or III))
2.	What are the expected analyses to be performed using which tools? The expected tool is IDA ICE and Be18, but you need to describe what optimisation calculations you want to perform. Examples are room height, ventilation concept, need for solar shading and similar. But the actual calculations depends on your project and focus area.
3.	Outline expected interfaces with the work from the other subjects?
4.	Describe alternative solutions (preferably in a sketch) if the expected concept proves to be non-functional.
5.	How do you plan to ventilate the building? This is important in terms of how much room is needed and therefore information which is needed by the other subjects to proceed in their work. You should consider if you want to have only air handling units in the top and/or bottom of the building, or if you want to put an air handling unit on every 3 to 9 floors. While taking up less space in vertical shafts and basement/roof, this will require space on the floors as well as inlet and outlet openings in the façade. A decision on this point early is important for the design of the building.
6.	Make an outline for the content of the 13 week report. Notice that all this is only an outline of the EXPECTED work. Deviations and changes are allowed - especially if it is because you have come to new realisations!

## Part B
**@Peter/Christian Please check against [general Part B description](/Assignements/B.md#b1-drawings)**
### Subject Drawings
The Teams interdisciplinary drawings should include the following input from MEP:
1.	Initial results from the optimization of the building envelope.
2.	Expected energy supply system in building (heating and cooling)
3.	Ventilation concept.
4.	Section of floor from floor to floor (of next storey)
5.	Targets to be reached.

## Part C
**@Peter/Christian Please check against [general Part C description](/Assignements/C.md#c-consultant-reports)**
### Subject (Consultant) Report
Provide the team with a BIM model, if possible (we hope that it is), to support coordination with the other subjects. The BIM Model should contain: basement technical room (volumetric elements representing each parts should be added), the entire design in the core of the building, hot and cold areas, the pipes and ventilation in the core has to be detailed from the basement technical area to the top of the building, fans, and installations on top of the building. one complete designed floor of your choice with ducts, air vents, heating, cooling (suggested to be the floor you choose as a team to detail for all subjects)=> a chosen floor detailed fully containing all subjects elements.

#### BE18 Calculation
Most importantly a Be18 calculation showing the energy frame with the chosen building and energy concept should be included in the reporting.
The Be18 calculation must be based on the optimization based on thermal simulations in IDA ICE. All (important) input should be commented upon in the documentation report. Here the word important is stressed since it is only input with consequences towards the energy frame that should be mentioned. Typically, the most important input is:
1.	U-values of building envelope
2.	the window U- and g-value and light transmittance
3.	solar shading
4.	ventilation data (all of them)
5.	daylight factor
6.	heat pump units (if used)
7.	PV-panels (if used)
8.	solar thermal (if used)

N.B… Notice that this Be18 calculation is of course not final. It must still be updated when more detailed information is available, for instance U-values of constructions should be accurate when these have been finally decided upon - which will probably not happen until the 3-week (Part D) period.

#### Energy and Indoor Climate
Describe the energy concept and indoor climate in the documentation report. The most important points must be documented through a sensitivity analysis of the different parameters using IDA ICE. Based on this sensitivity analysis the team should be able to ensure that the building will be able to fulfil energy requirements at the end of the 3-week period. The sensitivity analysis must include multiple parameters taken from the list above and be based on the introduction given in the course. Detailed considerations of the boundary conditions towards other subject groups must be included - e.g. how much room do you need for ventilation ducts using Revit MEP (use tables in the early design phases), what is the vertical and horizontal HVAC routing, window dimensions, openings between rooms and size of atrium (if natural ventilation), required U-value of walls, ceiling and floor, operation data for the facility management (only very superficial) and so on…. A sketch of the supply of all technical installations (heating, cooling, hot water, circulation, cold water, sprinkling, sewage including pressure zones, location of technical floors must be included. This must be updated in the 3-week report.

In total the building design, which gives the energy demand in the building together with the energy supply and distribution system, defines the energy concept of the building. All of this must be documented based on the optimization and included in a Be18 and IDA ICE calculation to document that the main requirements can be met.

#### Ventilation Ducts
If the ventilation ducting has been decided, 3D drawings of ventilation ducts could be made using Revit MEP or similar on one floor in the building. See requirements for the 3-week BIM output for details. Relevant sections should be shown in the report.

## Part D 
**@Peter/Christian Please check against [general Part D description](/Assignements/D.md)**
### Subject (Consultant Report)
A final description of the chosen concepts for:
1.	Final technical systems layout
2.	Documented indoor climate (mostly concerning IAQ - indoor air quality - and thermal environment - hours above 26 °C and 27 °C for a number of exposed rooms and day-light in workspaces)
3.	Final Be18-calculation.
4.	Thermal environment and energy consumption must show compliance with design targets.

Further the reporting should contain detailed requirements or actual products for:
5.	Constructions (details on how to achieve the required U-value)
6.	Windows (U- and g-values)
7.	Ventilation system (if mechanical: dimensions and lay-out. At least one floor and the vertical ducting must be shown. If natural: openings and airflow patterns). In both cases this must be shown in drawings using Revit MEP.
8.	other systems (heat pumps, solar thermal, PV, district heating, boreholes and so on and so forth)

#### Ventilation ducts
3D drawings of ventilation ducts could be made using Revit MEP or similar on one floor in the building. At least two critical sections should be shown in the scale relevant for showing the sections, to document that there is sufficient room for the ducts. Typically 1:50 or higher. Normally the critical sections are found where supply and return ducts intersect or right after exiting/entering the shaft. Further you should show the main ducts for ventilation in the building (not including the distribution ducts on the floors), including ventilation units and intakes/outlets.

*N.B….You should also be aware that the air intake and outlet of ventilation air will take up a lot of room, especially if the ventilation units are placed on the floors of the building - and not in the basement and/or top floor. In total the building design, which gives the energy demand in the building together with the energy supply and distribution system, defines the energy concept of the building. All of this must be documented based on the optimization and included in a Be18 and IDA ICE calculation to document that the main requirements can be met.*

### BIM
'
**@Peter/Christian Please check against [Part D bim description](/Assignements/D.md#d-bim)**

BIM: Required spaces for building services elements. Include a detailed model of ventilation system at an office floor and main vertical services in the core.
Choose 1 floor level from the above-detailed ones and add all your HVAC components. Create volume delimitation (boxes with names on it – ask PM Subject for the explanation if needed) in the basement technical floor representing space division for the components. Vertical Inlet and Outlet ventilation from the basement to the top of the building based on your design criteria have to be included (is it continuous or not?).
