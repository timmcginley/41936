*The subject concerns building services and building energy has the purpose of ensuring that the building has low energy consumption and acceptable indoor climate concerning both thermal and atmospheric air quality as well as day lighting conditions.*

In the MEP subject, the work is to establish the technical design parameters of the building. This comprises both passive and active design strategies which is to be implemented in concepts for heating, cooling and ventilation. Therefore, MEP Subject will work with room dimensions, daylight, façade design, ventilation type, heating and cooling supply, thermal simulations. One specific issue is to develop a system which will work in a high-rise building, which means that location of technical floors (mainly ventilation), pressure zones and space needed for the supply must be considered. The work in the subject requires – at least in the early phases – a large amount of coordination and integration with mainly subject 1, but also subject 2 and 5 are very important partners. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible.

## Requirements

### Facade and room dimensions
Design the facade focusing on:
- Glazing share of the facade
- The sun shading system, you should consider
- Visual comfort (glare etc. - Check DS_EN 17037_2018)
- Overheating
- Good daylighting conditions (is possible use Daylight Autonomy (DS_EN 17037)
- how the facade of the building affects indoor climate.
Design the rooms focusing on:
-	possible depth of rooms where permanent work spaces are possible
-	room height

### Tech floor basement
Technical floor basement requirement is probably the same as the building footprint. It is important that this need is communicated to the architecture team. An initial layout of the functions should be included in the drawings. Do consider how to get from technical room to shaft (e.g. ventilation ducts take up a lot of room)
### Energy frame
The energy requirements to be fulfilled in the project is equal to those put forward in the Building Code preferably including energy frame requirements from the low energy class.
### Indoor climate
The thermal and atmospheric indoor climate must correspond to at least Category II in EN 15251.
### Daylight
Daylight requirements at workspaces are important. Meeting rooms and corridors have no formal daylight requirements. Adjust the footprint of the building so workspaces have daylight and avoid unusable space.
Daylight must meet either one of the following requirements based on the Danish building code minimum requirements and DS/EN 17037 further specified in:
1.	There should be 300 lux in at least half of the area with permanent workspaces in at least 50% of the hours with daylight. This is the preferred solution (daylight autonomy)
2.	As a workaround, daylight may be documented with a daylight factor of 2.1% in at least half the area with workspaces and at least 0.7% on all workspaces.
### Daylight Autonomy
Solutions with high levels of daylight autonomy are preferred by the Client. You can use daylight autonomy actively to reduce window size and cooling load in highly solar loaded rooms.
### Acoustic Requirements
Acoustic requirements according to national Danish regulation.
### Comfort supply concept
Heating, cooling and ventilation can be supplied to the room in a number of different ways. They each have different advantages and disadvantages in terms of energy, indoor climate and space requirements. You need to ensure that you choose a system which can be integrated with the other subjects.
### Thermal simulations
The optimal combination of low energy consumption and good indoor climate (including daylight) must be found using some sort of sensitivity parameter variation routine. This optimization should be done using IDA ICE (or similar). The purpose is to find the optimal set of parameters in combination with the other design requirements by the other subjects. This sensitivity analysis is a major input from subject 3 to the discussion and shaping/design of the building.
The data from the following table must be used in setting up the thermal simulations.

```{Note}
Note 1: Area calculated excluding buffet area.

Note 2: Heat gain determined after kitchen design.

Note 3: The following occupancy load is used:
- Kl. 8-11 80 %
- Kl. 11-13 25 % (lunch break)
- Kl. 13-16 80 %
- Kl. 16-17 25 %

Note 4: The following occupancy load is used in meeting rooms:
- Kl. 8-12 100 %
- Kl. 12-13 0 % (lunch break)
- Kl. 13-15 100 %
- Kl. 15-17 50 %

Note 5: The area includes the whole floor area including corridors, walking areas, break-out spaces etc. In practice the occupancy load in the landscape office is probably 6-7 m2/person.

```



Generally
- Equipment: comprise laptops and screens and other person-related equipment like IP-telephone, mobile charger, height adjustable desks etc.
- Other equipment: comprise load from equipment that is not person-related, like projectors, flat screens, photocopiers, printers etc. Comprise also standby-load from building control systems like sensors, motors, actuators, wi-fi etc., totalling 3 W/m².
- There are no smokers in the entire building.

### Heating and cooling
The energy supply system must supply heating and cooling to the building to meet the demand. The room heat supply can be by radiators, convectors, floor heating or other that integrates well with the other building services. Heat production should be from district heating, however electrical heat pumps and/or, solar thermal should be considered as a supplement. Cooling preferably from district cooling, and/or compressor cooling. It is important to show that the heating and cooling system in the rooms of the building are able to supply sufficient heating and cooling. This must be documented based on simulations for cooling in selected rooms (taken from the thermal simulations based on the chosen design parameters from the sensitivity analyses). For heating it should be documented that the building can uphold 20C with -12C outdoor, as described in DS418.
### High rise building
As you are designing a high-rise building, you must also define and document how heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, cold water, sewage, sprinkling is laid out in the building. You will also need to include several pressure zones for heating and cooling and specific floors for technical installations mainly due to ventilation requirements.
### Space management in shafts
The space required in the shafts should be considered and included in the design. You should also be aware that the other installations such as sewage, water, electrical cabling and garbage should also be considered. You should not make detailed design in your project, but you must make sure that there is room for this. Notice that the pressure zones in a high-rise building mean that you need more than one set of pipes for e.g. heating, cooling and water supply. You should work closely with subject 6 and 1 for this.
### Space management on floors
On the floors the input from subject 3 is to make sure that the design ensures acceptable indoor climate fulfilling the requirements. As part of this, the space required for technical installations (mainly due to ventilation) must be sufficiently included in the design. This is the case in both a vertical and horizontal direction.
### Space management in basement 
Make sure that there is sufficient space for the technical installations in the basement. There should be allocated areas for heating, cooling, fire station, ventilation (if applicable), sewage, electrical switchboards. The layout should enable seamless integration with the shafts. 
### Maintenance access
Optimal access to technical installations in plant rooms and along ducts and pipes.

## Assignments

### Part A
#### Plan and Team Contract
Identify the parts of the project and the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for the MEP group for the 13 and 3 week period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be coordinated by your PM group. The main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; initial space management for technical rooms/floors, shafts. The concept for heating, cooling and ventilation. Input to design of windows, floor height, and thermal mass.
Consider the following points to help you in planning the activities schedule.
1.	Detail the **success criteria** (energy class, daylight factors, indoor climate category (I, II or III))
2.	What are the expected analyses to be performed using which tools? The expected tool is IDA ICE and Be18, but you need to describe what optimisation calculations you want to perform. Examples are room height, ventilation concept, need for solar shading and similar. But the actual calculations depends on your project and focus area.
3.	Outline expected interfaces with the work from the other subjects?
4.	Describe alternative solutions (preferably in a sketch) if the expected concept proves to be non-functional.
5.	How do you plan to ventilate the building? This is important in terms of how much room is needed and therefore information which is needed by the other subjects to proceed in their work. You should consider if you want to have only air handling units in the top and/or bottom of the building, or if you want to put an air handling unit on every 3 to 9 floors. While taking up less space in vertical shafts and basement/roof, this will require space on the floors as well as inlet and outlet openings in the façade. A decision on this point early is important for the design of the building.
6.	Make an outline for the content of the 13 week report. Notice that all this is only an outline of the EXPECTED work. Deviations and changes are allowed - especially if it is because you have come to new realisations!

### Part B
**@Peter/Christian Please check against [general Part B description](/Assignements/B.md#b1-drawings)**
#### Subject Drawings
The Teams interdisciplinary drawings should include the following input from MEP:
1.	Initial results from the optimization of the building envelope.
2.	Expected energy supply system in building (heating and cooling)
3.	Ventilation concept.
4.	Section of floor from floor to floor (of next storey)
5.	Targets to be reached.

### Part C
**@Peter/Christian Please check against [general Part C description](/Assignements/C.md#c-consultant-reports)**
#### Subject (Consultant) Report
Provide the team with a BIM model, if possible (we hope that it is), to support coordination with the other subjects. The BIM Model should contain: basement technical room (volumetric elements representing each parts should be added), the entire design in the core of the building, hot and cold areas, the pipes and ventilation in the core has to be detailed from the basement technical area to the top of the building, fans, and installations on top of the building. one complete designed floor of your choice with ducts, air vents, heating, cooling (suggested to be the floor you choose as a team to detail for all subjects)=> a chosen floor detailed fully containing all subjects elements.

##### BE18 Calculation
Most importantly a Be18 calculation showing the energy frame with the chosen building and energy concept should be included in the reporting.
The Be18 calculation must be based on the optimization based on thermal simulations in IDA ICE. All (important) input should be commented upon in the documentation report. Here the word important is stressed since it is only input with consequences towards the energy frame that should be mentioned. Typically, the most important input is:
1.	U-values of building envelope
2.	the window U- and g-value and light transmittance
3.	solar shading
4.	ventilation data (all of them)
5.	daylight factor
6.	heat pump units (if used)
7.	PV-panels (if used)
8.	solar thermal (if used)

N.B… Notice that this Be18 calculation is of course not final. It must still be updated when more detailed information is available, for instance U-values of constructions should be accurate when these have been finally decided upon - which will probably not happen until the 3-week (Part D) period.

##### Energy and Indoor Climate
Describe the energy concept and indoor climate in the documentation report. The most important points must be documented through a sensitivity analysis of the different parameters using IDA ICE. Based on this sensitivity analysis the team should be able to ensure that the building will be able to fulfil energy requirements at the end of the 3-week period. The sensitivity analysis must include multiple parameters taken from the list above and be based on the introduction given in the course. Detailed considerations of the boundary conditions towards other subject groups must be included - e.g. how much room do you need for ventilation ducts using Revit MEP (use tables in the early design phases), what is the vertical and horizontal HVAC routing, window dimensions, openings between rooms and size of atrium (if natural ventilation), required U-value of walls, ceiling and floor, operation data for the facility management (only very superficial) and so on…. A sketch of the supply of all technical installations (heating, cooling, hot water, circulation, cold water, sprinkling, sewage including pressure zones, location of technical floors must be included. This must be updated in the 3-week report.

In total the building design, which gives the energy demand in the building together with the energy supply and distribution system, defines the energy concept of the building. All of this must be documented based on the optimization and included in a Be18 and IDA ICE calculation to document that the main requirements can be met.

##### Ventilation Ducts
If the ventilation ducting has been decided, 3D drawings of ventilation ducts could be made using Revit MEP or similar on one floor in the building. See requirements for the 3-week BIM output for details. Relevant sections should be shown in the report.

### Part D 
**@Peter/Christian Please check against [general Part D description](/Assignements/D.md)**
#### Subject (Consultant Report)
A final description of the chosen concepts for:
1.	Final technical systems layout
2.	Documented indoor climate (mostly concerning IAQ - indoor air quality - and thermal environment - hours above 26 °C and 27 °C for a number of exposed rooms and day-light in workspaces)
3.	Final Be18-calculation.
4.	Thermal environment and energy consumption must show compliance with design targets.

Further the reporting should contain detailed requirements or actual products for:
5.	Constructions (details on how to achieve the required U-value)
6.	Windows (U- and g-values)
7.	Ventilation system (if mechanical: dimensions and lay-out. At least one floor and the vertical ducting must be shown. If natural: openings and airflow patterns). In both cases this must be shown in drawings using Revit MEP.
8.	other systems (heat pumps, solar thermal, PV, district heating, boreholes and so on and so forth)

##### Ventilation ducts
3D drawings of ventilation ducts could be made using Revit MEP or similar on one floor in the building. At least two critical sections should be shown in the scale relevant for showing the sections, to document that there is sufficient room for the ducts. Typically 1:50 or higher. Normally the critical sections are found where supply and return ducts intersect or right after exiting/entering the shaft. Further you should show the main ducts for ventilation in the building (not including the distribution ducts on the floors), including ventilation units and intakes/outlets.

*N.B….You should also be aware that the air intake and outlet of ventilation air will take up a lot of room, especially if the ventilation units are placed on the floors of the building - and not in the basement and/or top floor. In total the building design, which gives the energy demand in the building together with the energy supply and distribution system, defines the energy concept of the building. All of this must be documented based on the optimization and included in a Be18 and IDA ICE calculation to document that the main requirements can be met.*

#### D BIM

**@Peter/Christian Please check against [Part D bim description](/Assignements/D.md#d-bim)**

BIM: Required spaces for building services elements. Include a detailed model of ventilation system at an office floor and main vertical services in the core.
Choose 1 floor level from the above-detailed ones and add all your HVAC components. Create volume delimitation (boxes with names on it – ask PM Subject for the explanation if needed) in the basement technical floor representing space division for the components. Vertical Inlet and Outlet ventilation from the basement to the top of the building based on your design criteria have to be included (is it continuous or not?). 

## Integration

### MEP -> Architecture
The work in subject 3 will initially be in close cooperation with Subject 1 where the main design parameters of the building should be established. That is; floor plans (including space for technical installations), design of windows, floor height, ventilation concept, heating and cooling system (especially if building integrated solutions are used), and thermal mass. Keep in mind that establishing the right combination of design parameters in the very early phase of the process is the only way to ensure that satisfactory indoor climate and low energy consumption in the building can be made possible.
It is important for the work in subject 3 that it is coordinated with the work from the other subjects - mainly subject 1 and 2. An example of this coordination is to estimate how much space is required for the ventilation system and other technical installations in both the horizontal (on the floor) and vertical direction (shafts). Consider which services to put in basement, at technical floors and close to sky bar. This must initially be based on rules of thumb, but later on based on more advanced methods.

### MEP -> Structures
It is important very early on to establish the floor height including room height, deck construction and the cavity above the suspended ceiling (if you have one). This needs input from subject 1, 2 and 3.

Beams in façade take window height and daylight. Are there designated spaces for routing of installations? Do installations collide with columns or beams? E.g. are the radiator pipes at the façade blocked by columns or do beams block the ducting?
- Do the structural elements create thermal bridges through the insulated building envelope? This is relevant for façade but also for roof or basement floors that separates warm space from parking space.
- Do the installation have to go through structural components, and is that a structural problem? Small holes in some parts of the beam is often acceptable

### MEP -> PM/ICT
MEP constitutes a significant share of total costs. Air-borne heating and cooling may be cheap to purchase but occupies more rentable space than hydronic h/c systems. Therefore, the MEP has to coordinate with the PM from cost perspective, BIM Model quality assurance and space management.
- Be aware of the waste management system you chose, to remove the waste from the building and coordinate the height of the basement accordingly. Is it from –1 Level, removed by a waste management truck, that results in a higher floor to floor for –1 Level than for –2 Level and –3 Level. That provides a bigger volume floor to floor x area, for the MEP – 1 Level technical floor. This results in the access ramp to be either inside or outside the excavation/retaining system area, therefore, coordination of these has to be between Geotechnical Engineer, Structural Engineer, Architect, MEP, Fire and PM.
