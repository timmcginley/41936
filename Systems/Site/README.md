# Site
It is obvious but sometimes overlooked as we focus on the 'product' of the building. The [building](/41936/Systems/Building) could not exist without a site, it is its first constraint. Its soil determines the loads the that the building can exert on it. Its access routes have an affect on the circulation of the building. It is the lowest point of the [core](/41936/Systems/Core), which signifies the centre and origin of the building. 

## Architecture
* Consider how your building creates a sense of place. How are you ‘treating’
the surrounding area.
* Have you considered the landscaping around the building?
* is there a hard separation between the inside and outside? If so, is this required?
