# Project Requirements

Your building and your design process should be agile and prepared for change - neither should be surprised by it. Neither should be too precious, the best results are rarely obtained first time. 

The design of your building should satisfy the following requirements. Remember that Project requirements in this course justify 1/3 of your grade for the course. This includes the list below AND and any additional requirments introduced by the client through the process.

## The Project

DTU's expected growth and strategic investment in research, education and innovation creates. Capacity analyses have shown a need for 33.000 new sqm over the next 10-15 years. 

We have previously sought to find these in a tall new building, this year  we want to find most of this space by changing theuse of existing buildings and incorporating some new build.

## The Site
You will be able to choose from different sites including:

### Building 308
### Building 304
### Building 115

## Site Boundary 
The site boundary should be the same as the existing building.

## The Building 

The design is for DTU building 313, but with an alternative use. It should provide a modern landmark for research, and it should signal technical engineering skills, while giving a 'DTU feeling' of core professionalism, innovation, and sustainability in the building. The building and its near surroundings should be inviting, encourage inclusion and be a place where researchers, employees and students are thriving. 

### Danish Building Code 2018 

The overall requirement is that the building design meets Danish Building Code from 2018. 

### Typology (multi tenanted office) 

The project should provide multi tenancy offices. The building must be designed for multiple users who will share arrival areas and a number of facilities. 

### Connection to Campus 

Explain the relationship between the building complex and the rest of the campus 

### Height limit 27 m

**The ultimate height for this year will be 27m (nothing above but air).** This has been _reduced_ from previous years to be _more realistic_ and align to the municipality's plan and DTU Campus plan. Check [beats] 1 and 12 for extra information that has to be taken into account. 

## Floors

### GFA
The total building should not exceed 6000m2.

* No floor in building 308 can have a GFA greater than 2500m2.
* No floor in building 304 can have a GFA greater than 2000m2.
* No floor in building 115 can have a GFA greater than 1500m2.

### Floor to floor height
This needs to be carefully considered.

### Underground floors (3000m2)?

If you have a geo consultant then you must have a minimum of 2 floors of basement. This should be possible that support the underground building services requirements and storage.

## Spaces

### Flexible 

Flexible and robust office building that can accommodate a range of tenants. 

## Parking provision 

2 level underground parking space. (Remember to add what building services need to work out the total!) 

## Building Accessories and finishes
### Balconies 

Balconies are permitted and they are not included in the GFA (gross floor area). 






## Fire
Fire requirements for all teams: 

* Max 25 m escape routes 
* 2 staircases out to the free! 
* 120 cm free width door 
* Staircase 1 m minimum width 
* Pressurized staircase (space for it) 
* Space for sprinkler, sprinkler needed 
* Raising pipes 
* Rescue elevator 
* No combustible surfaces 
* R120 rating for all structural elements

<!-- Depreciated Requirements

## Car parking spaces (1 car/100m2 GFA) 

You must provide 1 car parking space per 100m2 build. It is important to consider the impact this will have on the basement for instance and to liaise with the other subjects to make this work. Additionally, you should carefully consider the DGNB Criteria ECO2.2 which allocates points for parking - and not as you might first think… 

## Bicycle parking spaces (1 bicycle(s) / 25m2 build) 

You must provide 1 bike parking spaces per 25m2 build. Special attention should be paid to cyclists so that cycle traffic to the buildings will be an attractive option. 

## Sustainable 

Your proposal should have a clear justification for the sustainability of the proposed project. How does your work contribute to the sustainability level your team is committed to? 

DTU wants the project to introduce and investigate a circular approach, where sustainable considerations permeate the decision making. DTU aims to increase the standard for circular buildings, where design is performed innovatively with clever use of materials. 

B313 should ensure a good environment for both people, flora, and fauna on campus. 

DTU wants to maintain a green campus with landscapes in the future and has developed a strategic campus plan (To be released soon) that supports this. Any landscape/nature included in a new building must be replaced by new actions in the outdoor environment.
