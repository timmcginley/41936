# Project Requirements 2025

Your building and your design process should be agile and prepared for change - neither should be surprised by it. Neither should be too precious, the best results are rarely obtained first time. 

The design of your building should satisfy the following requirements. Remember that Project requirements in this course justify 1/3 of your grade for the course. This includes the list below AND and any additional requirments introduced by the client through the process.

## The Project

DTU's expected growth and strategic investment in research, education and innovation creates. Capacity analyses have shown a need for 33.000 new sqm over the next 10-15 years. 

We have previously sought to find these in a tall new building, this year  we want to find most of this space by changing theuse of existing buildings and incorporating some new build.

The project is for it needs to provide space for students and researchers. It is not officially attached to any department at DTU, a bit like skylab but without the focus on supporting start ups. 

## The Site
You will be able to choose from different sites including:

### Building 308
### Building 304
### Building 115

## Site Boundary 
The site boundary should be the same as the existing building.

## The Building 

The design is for DTU building 313, but with an alternative use. It should provide a modern landmark for research, and it should signal technical engineering skills, while giving a 'DTU feeling' of core professionalism, innovation, and sustainability in the building. The building and its near surroundings should be inviting, encourage inclusion and be a place where researchers, employees and students are thriving. 

### Danish Building Code 2018 

The overall requirement is that the building design meets Danish Building Code from 2018. 

### Typology (multi tenanted office) 

The project should provide multi tenancy offices. The building must be designed for multiple users who will share arrival areas and a number of facilities. 

### Connection to Campus 

Explain the relationship between the building complex and the rest of the campus 

### Height limit 27 m

**The ultimate height for this year will be 27m (nothing above but air).** This has been _reduced_ from previous years to be _more realistic_ and align to the municipality's plan and DTU Campus plan. Check [beats] 1 and 12 for extra information that has to be taken into account. 

## Floors

### GFA
The total building should not exceed 6000m2.

* No floor in building 308 can have a GFA greater than 2500m2.
* No floor in building 304 can have a GFA greater than 2000m2.
* No floor in building 115 can have a GFA greater than 1500m2.

### Floor to floor height
This needs to be carefully considered.

### Underground floors (3000m2)?

If you have a geo consultant then you must have a minimum of 2 floors of basement. This should be possible that support the underground building services requirements and storage.

### Public top floor 

The building must have an observatory with public access. 

### Public ground floor 

The building must have a mostly public ground floor including reception area to serve the auditorium and multi sue space and will also be the centre of security monitoring and access control. The division between public and 'private' DTU areas should be clear.

### Office Floor(s) 

The office floor should feature maximum flexibility to support flexible multi-tenant occupation. The designs should support both open plan offices and cellular offices for up to six persons, not necessarily at the same time. Each office floor shall have minimum three small meeting rooms. These rooms blur that you could book for a week rather than just an hour or so like a meeting room, they are a space for people to come together from different disciplines to solve specific.

One plan would be for traditional cellular office 

**The offices need to provide space for 1000 desks.**

## Spaces
## Researcher Space

## Teaching and Learning spaces

### Auditorium (100 people) 

The building must include an auditorium. The auditorium should be completely or partly located inside the building. 

### Multipurpose space

The building must include a 250 m2 multipurpose space with a height of 6m, without columns, with access for a small forklift.

### Café facilities 

The building must include a café for minimum 50 persons. Consider what facilities need to be offered by the café.

## Meeting rooms

### Meeting Rooms (25 people) 

2 x 25 people 

### Meeting Rooms (15 people) 

10 x 15 people 

### Soundproof Office Booth
5 booth per office and student floors for 1-2 person.

## Student Area

### Student Area 

Area for students. 
<!-- including permanent desk spaces - 300. see Beat 14 for details. -->
<!--
### Atrium 

The building should include an atrium (visually connected to the foyer) to provide visual understanding of the inside of the building, it is up to your team how high / big this is. 
-->

### Additional
* As many spaces as possible should support several functions.

### Flexible 

Flexible and robust office building that can accommodate a range of tenants. 

## Parking provision 

2 level underground parking space. (Remember to add what building services need to work out the total!) 

## Building Accessories and finishes
### Balconies 

Balconies are permitted and they are not included in the GFA (gross floor area). 






## Fire
Fire requirements for all teams: 

* Max 25 m escape routes 
* 2 staircases out to the free! 
* 120 cm free width door 
* Staircase 1 m minimum width 
* Pressurized staircase (space for it) 
* Space for sprinkler, sprinkler needed 
* Raising pipes 
* Rescue elevator 
* No combustible surfaces 
* R120 rating for all structural elements

<!-- Depreciated Requirements

## Car parking spaces (1 car/100m2 GFA) 

You must provide 1 car parking space per 100m2 build. It is important to consider the impact this will have on the basement for instance and to liaise with the other subjects to make this work. Additionally, you should carefully consider the DGNB Criteria ECO2.2 which allocates points for parking - and not as you might first think… 

## Bicycle parking spaces (1 bicycle(s) / 25m2 build) 

You must provide 1 bike parking spaces per 25m2 build. Special attention should be paid to cyclists so that cycle traffic to the buildings will be an attractive option. 

## Sustainable 

Your proposal should have a clear justification for the sustainability of the proposed project. How does your work contribute to the sustainability level your team is committed to? 

DTU wants the project to introduce and investigate a circular approach, where sustainable considerations permeate the decision making. DTU aims to increase the standard for circular buildings, where design is performed innovatively with clever use of materials. 

B313 should ensure a good environment for both people, flora, and fauna on campus. 

DTU wants to maintain a green campus with landscapes in the future and has developed a strategic campus plan (To be released soon) that supports this. Any landscape/nature included in a new building must be replaced by new actions in the outdoor environment.
