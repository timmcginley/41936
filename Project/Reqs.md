# Project Requirements 2025

Your building and your design process should be agile and prepared for change - neither should be surprised by it. Neither should be too precious, the best results are rarely obtained first time. 

The design of your building should satisfy the following requirements. Remember that Project requirements in this course justify 1/3 of your grade for the course. This includes the list below AND and any additional requirments introduced by the client through the process.

## The Project

DTU's expected growth and strategic investment in research, education and innovation creates. Capacity analyses have shown a need for 33.000 new sqm over the next 10-15 years. This project is intended to provide a minimum 3000m2 of additional area.

In 2024 we had one project, we have now run this 6 times with the same project, resulting in 59 buildings with (roughly) the same brief - the main difference is changes in height limits.

In future iterations of the course we will have different versions that you can choose from. This should reflect the rising importance of experience working on renovations rather than new buildings. This will be linked to the interest of the mentor that you are working on your project with. As an idea these alternatives could be:

1. Tall building (the same project we have run since 2019)
2. Typical DTU building renovation / addition
3. 101 building renovation / addition
4. Skylab renovation / addition

All options have the same brief of accomodation. However they will be compared against each other in terms of sustainbility, cost and time etc.

### Project KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
>This is the engine of the course. These can be combined with other figures to provide an overview on the progress of the teams.


In this first session of the course you will be introduced to your teachers and meet with the other members of your subject. You will be asked to divide into groups and to consider what is important for your subject group / company.  

In week 1 of the project, the PMs set their KPIs to describe the values of the team, the other subjects can then bid to be part of these teams based on the values. In your subjects you will be expected to make subject specific decisions that support the stated (KPI) values of your team. 

#### DGNB / Sustainability 

DTU wants B313 to achieve a DGNB certification at minimum DGNB ‘Lite’ Gold level. Please see the seperate DGNB Lite schema for details, that contains a reduced set of criteria for you to achieve each week. We have reduced the criteria and adjusted the points so that LCA for instance gains greater importance. The ‘level’ must be decided by your PM as either: 

DGNB “Lite” - silver, gold or platinum 

#### COST 

The cost level is decided by your PM in balance with sustainability goals and especially time budget. Refer to the PM subject document for what to include in costs. The construction budget depends on the resulting gross area and must be either:  

30.000DKK/m2, 35.000DKK/m2 or 40.000DKK/m2

<!-- 2024 
60.000DKK/m2, 65.000DKK/m2 or 70.000DKK/m2 
-->

#### TIME 

The time budget is also flexible, and defined by the PM. The durations (incl. design proposal period) to choose between are respectively: 

30 months, 35 months or 40 months 

<!--
## USER 
This describes the spatial efficiency of the building. This calculation is focused on the heated areas of the building. We will ask you to provide the GFA/person for the non-heated area too, but not as a KPI. The reason for this is, that in this course we need the below ground for the geotechnical subject but, in a real project it is not possible to include the lower floors and still hit the KPI targets here - so we will not ask you to do it, but please consider this in future projects! 

1800 permanent desks, 1600 permanent desks, 1400 permanent desks
-->

<!-- thoughts on numbers
Roughly 200 students involved in Advanced Building design - 200 students and 200 staff?

--->

#### Points allocation

|        | 1 pts | 3 pts | 5 pts |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| Time   | 30 months | 35 months | 40 months |
| Cost   | 30k dkk/m2 | 35k dkk/m2| 40k dkk/m2 |
| DGNB (Lite)   | Platinum | Gold | Silver |

<!--
| People/desks | 1800 | 1600  | 1400   |
-->

In the session (PM Only): If you are in PM decide on the KPI values and make a describe these in the form. Each team has a number of points depending on how many points they got from their team selection and has to choose how to spend them on KPIs. These are explained in more detail above and their values are summarised here. For example, if we wanted to do a small expensive sustainable building quickly we could choose:
> 30 months (1 point) + 75.000DKK/M2 (3 pt) + platinum (1 point)  = 5 Points

We have previously sought to find these in a tall new building, this year  we want to find most of this space by changing theuse of existing buildings and incorporating some new build.

The project is for it needs to provide space for students and researchers. It is not officially attached to any department at DTU, a bit like skylab but without the focus on supporting start ups. 

## The Site
You will be able to choose from different sites including:

### Building 308
Current GFA Gross (4.684 m2) Net (4.320 m2)
* More complex renovation (space plan) but less floors requied on top.

### Building 304
Current GFA Gross (1.810 m2) Net (1.623 m2)
* Some cellular offices but mainly computers
* The computers will be moved to another location
* Building could be demolished but materails should be retained.
* Most suitable project for rebuild

### Building 115
Current GFA Gross (5.736 m2) Net (5.188 m2)
* Currently used as offices only
* Needs to be Modernised
* Improve collaboration
* Interaction between students and staff
* Most simple renovation case, but would require more floors on top

### Site Boundary 
The site boundary should be the same as the existing building.

## The Building 

The design is for DTU building 313, but with an alternative use. It should provide a modern landmark for research, and it should signal technical engineering skills, while giving a 'DTU feeling' of core professionalism, innovation, and sustainability in the building. The building and its near surroundings should be inviting, encourage inclusion and be a place where researchers, employees and students are thriving. 

### Building Typology (multi tenanted office) 

The project should provide multi tenancy offices. The building must be designed for multiple users who will share arrival areas and a number of facilities. 

### Building 308
Current GFA Gross (4.684 m2) Net (4.320 m2)
* More complex renovation (space plan) but less floors requied on top.

### Building 304
Current GFA Gross (1.810 m2) Net (1.623 m2)
* Some cellular offices but mainly computers
* The computers will be moved to another location
* Building could be demolished but materails should be retained.
* Most suitable project for rebuild

### Building 115
Current GFA Gross (5.736 m2) Net (5.188 m2)
* Currently used as offices only
* Needs to be Modernised
* Improve collaboration
* Interaction between students and staff
* Most simple renovation case, but would require more floors on top

### Connection to Campus 

Explain the relationship between the building complex and the rest of the campus 

### Height limit 27 m

**The ultimate height for this year will be 27m (nothing above but air).** This has been _reduced_ from previous years to be _more realistic_ and align to the municipality's plan and DTU Campus plan. Check [beats] 1 and 12 for extra information that has to be taken into account. 

## Floors

### GFA
The total building should not exceed 10000m2.
* No floor in building 308 can have a GFA greater than 2500m2.
* No floor in building 304 can have a GFA greater than 2000m2.
* No floor in building 115 can have a GFA greater than 1500m2.

### Floor to floor height
This needs to be carefully considered.

### Underground floors
If you have a geo consultant then you must have a minimum of 2 floors of basement. This should be possible that support the underground building services requirements and storage.

### Public top floor 
The building must have an accessible top floor including:
* Shared herb / vegetable
* Greenhouses
* Place to enjoy the sun / observe the stars

### Public ground floor 

The building must have a mostly public ground floor including reception area to serve the auditorium and will also be the centre of security monitoring and access control. The division between public and 'private' DTU areas should be clear.

### Office Floor(s) 

The office floor should feature maximum flexibility to support multi-tenant occupation. The designs should support both open plan offices and cellular offices for up to six persons, not necessarily at the same time. Each office floor shall have minimum three small meeting rooms. These rooms blur that you could book for a week rather than just an hour or so like a meeting room, they are a space for people to come together from different disciplines to solve specific.

One plan would be for traditional cellular office 

**The offices need to provide space for 1000 desks.**

## Spaces

Your proposal must include the following spaces.

### Auditorium (100 people) 

The building must include an auditorium. The auditorium should be completely or partly located inside the building. This should be your 'perfect auditorium' what would that be like? Make sure that both the presenter and the audience are physically and acoustically confortable etc. Please pay special attention to make sure that no one needs to 'twist their nexk' to see the presenter or the screen. Can the room also be used for other functions - if so what?

### Multipurpose space

The building must include a 250 m2 multipurpose space with a height of 6m, without columns, with access for a small forklift.

### Café facilities 

The building must include a café for minimum 50 persons. Consider what facilities need to be offered by the café.

### Materials Library

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/694d729f-7ba5-4412-b285-7a74024a242f)
[Materials Research Centre](https://www.fosterandpartners.com/people/teams/materials-research-centre), Foster and Partners

* 100m2 to include shelves and draws and a system to 'borrow' materials.
* Consider how the materials in the library should be classified / ordered to support the design of better, more sustainable buildings.

### Meeting rooms

* 2 x 25 people <mark>[adjust to new brief]</mark>
* 10 x 15 people <mark>[adjust to new brief]</mark>

### Soundproof Office Booth
5 booth per office and student floors for 1-2 person.

### Student Area 

Area for students. 
<!-- including permanent desk spaces - 300. see Beat 14 for details. -->

### Atrium 

The building should include an atrium (visually connected to the foyer) to provide visual understanding of the inside of the building, it is up to your team how high / big this is. 

### Additional
* As many spaces as possible should support several functions.

### Flexible 

Flexible and robust office building that can accommodate a range of tenants. 

### Parking provision 

2 level underground parking space. (Remember to add what building services need to work out the total!) 

## Building Accessories and finishes
### Balconies 

Balconies are permitted and they are not included in the GFA (gross floor area). 



## Construction and Safety requirements
### Danish Building Code 2018 
The overall requirement is that the building design meets Danish Building Code from 2018. 

### Fire
Fire requirements for all teams: 

* Max 25 m escape routes 
* 2 staircases out to the free! 
* 120 cm free width door 
* Staircase 1 m minimum width 
* Pressurized staircase (space for it) 
* Space for sprinkler, sprinkler needed 
* Raising pipes 
* Rescue elevator 
* No combustible surfaces 
* R120 rating for all structural elements

<!-- Depreciated Requirements

## Car parking spaces (1 car/100m2 GFA) 

You must provide 1 car parking space per 100m2 build. It is important to consider the impact this will have on the basement for instance and to liaise with the other subjects to make this work. Additionally, you should carefully consider the DGNB Criteria ECO2.2 which allocates points for parking - and not as you might first think… 

## Bicycle parking spaces (1 bicycle(s) / 25m2 build) 

You must provide 1 bike parking spaces per 25m2 build. Special attention should be paid to cyclists so that cycle traffic to the buildings will be an attractive option. 

## Sustainable 

Your proposal should have a clear justification for the sustainability of the proposed project. How does your work contribute to the sustainability level your team is committed to? 

DTU wants the project to introduce and investigate a circular approach, where sustainable considerations permeate the decision making. DTU aims to increase the standard for circular buildings, where design is performed innovatively with clever use of materials. 

B313 should ensure a good environment for both people, flora, and fauna on campus. 

DTU wants to maintain a green campus with landscapes in the future and has developed a strategic campus plan (To be released soon) that supports this. Any landscape/nature included in a new building must be replaced by new actions in the outdoor environment.
