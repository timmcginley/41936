# Project Reqs

## Project and Site requirements 

You should analyse these requirements this week (Learning Objective 01), what do they mean for your respective disciplines? 

## Building 

The design is for DTU building 313, but with an alternative use. It should provide a modern landmark for research, and it should signal technical engineering skills, while giving a 'DTU feeling' of core professionalism, innovation, and sustainability in the building. The building and its near surroundings should be inviting, encourage inclusion and be a place where researchers, employees and students are thriving. 

## Design 

The building should be designed taking the client brief into account. The building design should: 

* Be designed to provide a good environment for research, innovation and consulting
* Provide a strong visual and physical interaction between inside and outside in the new building and open floor plan in the ground floor. 
* Be high quality in terms of material and sustainability choices, giving the building an experience of a holistic design that
* Respectful of the architectural and engineering heritage of DTU in terms of spaces, facade expressions and materials. 
* Mirror the visions of sustainable direction for DTU and the future-oriented use of the project for research on climate adaption and energy solutions.  

DTU's expected growth and strategic investment in research, education and innovation creates. Capacity analyses have shown a need for 33.000 new sqm over the next 10-15 years - see project background for details. 

## Agile Building Design

Your building and your design process should be agile and prepared for change - neither should be surprised by it. Neither should be too precious, the best results are rarely obtained first time. 

## Height limit (27 m) - 67m!

The design proposal must provide a building, with a maximum building height of 100m. This is an ABSOLUTE limit for the building (only air can be above this). In reality, the height exceeds the masterplan for the area and would not be possible, but this is not a real project. Check beats 1 and 12 for extra information that has to be taken into account. 

## Site Boundary (1800 m2) 

The site for this imagined project is 1800m2 as indicated in the image below. The width is 30m and the length is 60m. 

This is because we need to: 
* provide fire trucks access to the building 
* reduce risk of fire spreading between the buildings

## Gross floor area (1400 m2) 

The area of the floor plate should not deviate +/-10% m2. It is possible for floors to be smaller if you can justify this. This is calculated as the average floor area (Beat 1 - GFA) divided by the # of floors above ground. 

## Car parking spaces (1 car/100m2 GFA) 

You must provide 1 car parking space per 100m2 build. It is important to consider the impact this will have on the basement for instance and to liaise with the other subjects to make this work. Additionally, you should carefully consider the DGNB Criteria ECO2.2 which allocates points for parking - and not as you might first think… 

## Bicycle parking spaces (1 bicycle(s) / 25m2 build) 

You must provide 1 bike parking spaces per 25m2 build. Special attention should be paid to cyclists so that cycle traffic to the buildings will be an attractive option. 

## Sustainable 

Your proposal should have a clear justification for the sustainability of the proposed project. How does your work contribute to the sustainability level your team is committed to? 

DTU wants the project to introduce and investigate a circular approach, where sustainable considerations permeate the decision making. DTU aims to increase the standard for circular buildings, where design is performed innovatively with clever use of materials. 

B313 should ensure a good environment for both people, flora, and fauna on campus. 

DTU wants to maintain a green campus with landscapes in the future and has developed a strategic campus plan (To be released soon) that supports this. Any landscape/nature included in a new building must be replaced by new actions in the outdoor environment. 

## Flexible 

Flexible and robust office building that can accommodate a range of tenants. 

## Connection to Campus 

Explain the relation between the building complex and the rest of the Campus 

## Connection to Building 310 

You can build above but MUST NOT transfer any loads to the existing buildings (the foundations would not have been designed for it). 310 touches our site in 2 places. You can either; build up to the edge of building 310 in both places or connect (knock through) to one space but stay at least 1m clear of the other. It is up to your group which you choose. 

## Minimum underground floors (3 floors) 

If you have a geo consultant then you must have a minimum of 3 underground floors, that support the underground building services requirements and parking levels. This will affect your C02 for the project and therefore you produce 2 CO2 figures, one including the basement and one without including the basement. 

## Typology (multi tenanted office) 

The project should provide multi tenancy offices. The building must be designed for multiple users who will share arrival areas and a number of facilities. 

## Parking provision 

2 level underground parking space. (Remember to add what building services need to work out the total!) 

## Balconies 

Balconies are permitted and they are not included in the GFA (gross floor area). 

## Danish Building Code 2018 

The overall requirement is that the building design meets Danish Building Code from 2018. 

## Provide useful BIM 

Provide relevant information in a timely manner to support the production of useful BIM. This should be in accordance with your ICT agreement. When producing information consider who it is for and how you are making it useful for them - what does it enable them to do?   

The client has previously been frustrated in building projects where they have found it difficult to access the project BIM. They have asked that the BIM is therefore shared by project in the Microsoft Teams platform using Speckle. Details for this will be provided. 

## Fire
Fire requirements for all teams: 

* Max 25 m escape routes 
* 2 staircases out to the free! 
* 120 cm free width door 
* Staircase 1 m minimum width 
* Pressurized staircase (space for it) 
* Space for sprinkler, sprinkler needed 
* Raising pipes 
* Rescue elevator 
* No combustible surfaces 
* R120 rating for all structural elements
