This describes the spatial efficiency of the building. This calculation is focused on the heated areas of the building. We will ask you to provide the GFA/person for the non-heated area too, but not as a KPI. The reason for this is, that in this course we need the below ground for the geotechnical subject but, in a real project it is not possible to include the lower floors and still hit the KPI targets here - so we will not ask you to do it, but please consider this in future projects!
