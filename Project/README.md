# Project

In 2024 we had one project, in future iterations of the course we will have different versions that you can choose. This will be linked to interest of the mentor that you are working on your project with. As an idea these alternatives will be:

1. Tall building (traditional breif)
2. Typical DTU building renovation / addition
3. 101 building renovation / addition

All options have the same brief of accomodation. However they will be compared against each other in terms of sustainbility, cost and time etc.
