# Project

In 2024 we had one project, we have now run this 6 times with the same project, resulting in 59 buildings with (roughly) the same brief - the main difference is changes in height limits.

In future iterations of the course we will have different versions that you can choose from. This should reflect the rising importance of experience working on renovations rather than new buildings. This will be linked to the interest of the mentor that you are working on your project with. As an idea these alternatives could be:

1. Tall building (the same project we have run since 2019)
2. Typical DTU building renovation / addition
3. 101 building renovation / addition
4. Skylab renovation / addition

All options have the same brief of accomodation. However they will be compared against each other in terms of sustainbility, cost and time etc.
