[AART](https://aart.dk/projekter/dtu-bygning-208)'s renovation of Building 208


## Project Requirements 2025

This course has run since 2007 and we have now run the same 6 times with the same project, resulting in 59 buildings with (roughly) the same brief - the main difference is changes in height limits. This has been great for developing a unique data set of common comparable buildings, that we can use to better understnad and improve our interdisciplinary design experiences. However from 2025 you will be able to choose from different buildings and their briefs will be set by emerging societal needs. 

This year's brief responds in part to recommendations from previous students that the course should focus on:
* Renovation and reuse of existing buildings
* Reuse / circularity of materials.
* Support exploration of emerging and biobased materials and components

Your building and your design process should be agile and prepared for change - neither should be surprised by it. Neither should be too precious, the best results are rarely obtained first time. The design of your building should satisfy the following requirements. Remember that Project requirements in this course justify 1/3 of your grade for the course. This includes the list below AND and any additional requirments introduced by the client through the process.

## The Project

DTU's expected growth and strategic investment in research, education and innovation creates a need for new buildings, which should be balanced alongside its maintenance and renovation of its existing building stock. Capacity analyses have shown a need for 33.000 new sqm over the next 10-15 years. your project will only provide a small part of the required future capacity. You will focus on one of three existing buildings 115, 304 or 308. All options have the same brief of accomodation. However they will be compared against each other in terms of sustainbility, cost and time etc.

### The Client
Buuildings on Campus tend to seperate researchers and students and divied the researchers into to (mostly) disciplinary departments. the client used to be a DTU reseracher before quitting and launching a hugely successful start up. They recently returned for an almuni event and remembering how much they enjoyed the opportunity to meet people wiht different interests from different backgrounds at DTU and wondered on the travel home how to do better support on campus collaboration. They came up wiht the following simple vision, that you are being asked to execute.

>  We need to take an ordinary DTU building and 'undiscipline' it we need to make it department free, a place where students or reserachers could book space to work together on specific projects and meet for weeks not hours. This building will be called DTU Fri.

at The client would imagines  a new The project needs to provide space for students and researchers. It is not officially attached to any department at DTU, a bit like skylab but without the focus on supporting start ups. The Client wants a dashboard to keep them updated on your progress throughout the project.

### Project KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
>This is the engine of the course. These can be combined with other figures to provide an overview of your Team's progress.

In this first session of the course you will be introduced to your teachers and meet with the other members of your subject. You will be asked to divide into groups and to consider what is important for your subject group / company.  

In week 1 of the project, the PMs set their KPIs to describe the values of the team, the other subjects can then bid to be part of these teams based on the values. In your subjects you will be expected to make subject specific decisions that support the stated (KPI) values of your team. 

#### DGNB

DTU wants B313 to achieve a DGNB certification at minimum DGNB ‘Lite’ Gold level. Please see the seperate DGNB Lite schema for details, that contains a reduced set of criteria for you to achieve each week. We have reduced the criteria and adjusted the points so that LCA for instance gains greater importance. The ‘level’ must be decided by your PM:

#### COST 

The cost level is decided by your PM in balance with sustainability goals and especially time budget. Refer to the PM subject document for what to include in costs. The construction budget depends on the resulting gross area:

#### LCA
it is important that all consultants keep a close eye on the LCA for the elements and systems they are responsible for.

## USER 
This is the total number of permanant desks in your building.

#### Points allocation

|                    | 1 pts    | 3 pts   | 5 pts   |
|--------------------|----------|---------|---------|
| CO2eq/m2/User      | 60       | 80      | 100     |
| Cost (dkk/m2)      | 30.000   | 35.000  | 40.000  |
| DGNB (Lite)        | Platinum | Gold    | Silver  |
| Perm. desk space   | 600      | 400     | 200     |


In the session (PM Only): If you are in PM decide on the KPI values and make a describe these in the form. Each team has a number of points depending on how many points they got from their team selection and has to choose how to spend them on KPIs. These are explained in more detail above and their values are summarised here. For example, if we wanted to do a small expensive sustainable building quickly we could choose:

> 60 (CO2eq/m2/User) (1 point) + 35.000DKK/M2 (3 pt) + platinum (1 point) + 400 desks (3 point) = 8 Points


## The Site
Teh site of the project is DTU Lyngby Campus. You will be able to choose from different sites including:

Overview of the different available sites available on DTU Lyngby Campus

### Site Boundary 
The site boundary should be the same as the existing building.

## The Building
YouR team should develop a design to renovates an existing building on Campus. It should provide:
* a modern landmark for research, .
* The building typology is a multi tenancy office building wiht research and teaching facilities.
* The building must be designed for multiple users who will share arrival areas and a number of facilities. 
* signal technical engineering skills,
* while giving a 'DTU feeling' of core professionalism, innovation, and sustainability in the building.
* The building and its near surroundings should be inviting, encourage inclusion and be a place where researchers, employees and students can thrive.
* Strong connection to the rest of the campus
  
You should choose one of the following buildings to renovate.

### Building 308
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3d23453-3d4c-478f-b255-17ca1d9185f4)

Current GFA Gross (4.684 m2) Net (4.320 m2)
* More complex renovation (space plan) but less floors requied on top.

### Building 304
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a56be984-a5a6-49b0-b181-c7a2454215b0)

Current GFA Gross (1.810 m2) Net (1.623 m2)
* Some cellular offices but mainly computers
* The computers will be moved to another location
* Building could be demolished but materails should be retained.
* Most suitable project for rebuild

### Building 115
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1e2e378-0c30-4f28-91c8-9a5a6741ad4d)
Current GFA Gross (5.736 m2) Net (5.188 m2)
* Currently used as offices only
* Needs to be Modernised
* Improve collaboration
* Interaction between students and staff
* Most simple renovation case, but would require more floors on top

### R1: Height limit 27 m

**The ultimate height for this year will be 27m (nothing above but air).** This has been _reduced_ from previous years to be _more realistic_ and align to the municipality's plan and DTU Campus plan. Check [beats] 1 and 12 for extra information that has to be taken into account. 

## Floors

### F01: GFA
The total building should not exceed 10000m2.
* No floor in building 308 can have a GFA greater than 2500m2.
* No floor in building 304 can have a GFA greater than 2000m2.
* No floor in building 115 can have a GFA greater than 1500m2.

Balconies are permitted and they are not included in the GFA (gross floor area).

### F02: Office Floor(s) 

The office floor should feature maximum flexibility to support multi-tenant occupation. The designs should support both open plan offices and cellular offices for up to six persons, not necessarily at the same time. Each office floor shall have minimum three small meeting rooms. These rooms blur that you could book for a week rather than just an hour or so like a meeting room, they are a space for people to come together from different disciplines to solve specific.

One plan would be for traditional cellular office 

**The offices needs to provide the desks promised in your user KPI**

### F03: Floor to floor height
This needs to be carefully considered.

### F04: Underground floors
If you have a geo consultant then you must have a minimum of 2 floors of basement. This should be possible that support the underground building services requirements and storage.

### F05: Public top floor 
The building must have an accessible top floor including:
* Shared herb / vegetable
* Greenhouses
* Place to enjoy the sun / observe the stars

### F06: Public ground floor 

The building must have a mostly public ground floor including reception area to serve the auditorium and will also be the centre of security monitoring and access control. The division between public and 'private' DTU areas should be clear.

## Spaces

Your proposal must include the following spaces.

### S01: Auditorium (100 people) 

The building must include an auditorium. The auditorium should be completely or partly located inside the building. This should be your 'perfect auditorium' what would that be like? Make sure that both the presenter and the audience are physically and acoustically confortable etc. Please pay special attention to make sure that no one needs to 'twist their nexk' to see the presenter or the screen. Can the room also be used for other functions - if so what?

### S02: Multipurpose space
The building must include multipurpose space:
* 250 m2 area
* 6m high
* Uninterupted by columns
* With access for a small forklift

### S03: Café facilities 
The building must include a café for minimum 50 persons. Consider what facilities need to be offered by the café.
* This is a place to go and get 'good' coffee.
* This is a place to meet informally, a variety of seating options should be included - think where the 'best seats are'?
* Does this have a good view?

### S04:Materials Library

[Materials Research Centre](https://www.fosterandpartners.com/people/teams/materials-research-centre), Foster and Partners

* 100m2 to include shelves and draws and a system to 'borrow' materials.
* Consider how the materials in the library should be classified / ordered to support the design of better, more sustainable buildings.

### S05: Meeting rooms

* 2 x 25 people <mark>[adjust to new brief]</mark>
* 10 x 15 people <mark>[adjust to new brief]</mark>

### S06: Soundproof Office Booth
5 booth per office and student floors for 1-2 person.

### S07: Student Area 
Area for students. For this you need to think what kind of spaces you like. 
<!-- including permanent desk spaces - 300. see Beat 14 for details. -->

### S08: Atrium 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5564e87d-59ff-4e14-9722-29762fc65c02)
Atrium in Building 208 [(AART)](https://aart.dk/en/projects/dtu-bygning-208)

The building should include an atrium (visually connected to the foyer) to provide visual understanding of the inside of the building, it is up to your team how high / big this is. 

### F09: Bicycle parking spaces (1 bicycle(s) / 25m2 build) 
You must provide 1 bike parking spaces per 25m2 build. Special attention should be paid to cyclists so that cycle traffic to the buildings will be an attractive option. 

## Construction and Safety requirements
### C01: Danish Building Code 2018 
The overall requirement is that the building design meets Danish Building Code from 2018. 

### C02: Fire Safety
Fire requirements for all teams: 

* Max 25 m escape routes 
* 2 staircases out to the free! 
* 120 cm free width door 
* Staircase 1 m minimum width 
* Pressurized staircase (space for it) 
* Space for sprinkler, sprinkler needed 
* Raising pipes 
* Rescue elevator 
* No combustible surfaces 
* R120 rating for all structural elements

<!-- Depreciated Requirements

## Car parking spaces (1 car/100m2 GFA) 

You must provide 1 car parking space per 100m2 build. It is important to consider the impact this will have on the basement for instance and to liaise with the other subjects to make this work. Additionally, you should carefully consider the DGNB Criteria ECO2.2 which allocates points for parking - and not as you might first think… 



## Sustainable 

Your proposal should have a clear justification for the sustainability of the proposed project. How does your work contribute to the sustainability level your team is committed to? 

DTU wants the project to introduce and investigate a circular approach, where sustainable considerations permeate the decision making. DTU aims to increase the standard for circular buildings, where design is performed innovatively with clever use of materials. 

B313 should ensure a good environment for both people, flora, and fauna on campus. 

DTU wants to maintain a green campus with landscapes in the future and has developed a strategic campus plan (To be released soon) that supports this. Any landscape/nature included in a new building must be replaced by new actions in the outdoor environment.
