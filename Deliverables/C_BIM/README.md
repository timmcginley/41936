# Stage C BIM

Structural -â€¯BIM / 3D models 

You should be developing the BIM model through the course. This might not be possible in the early stages, however, start as soon as possible when some elements are certain. To give you a guide you should expect to have a model that we can do a quantity take off from by week 10. The structural system of the entire building, basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire core should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines. The elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof.
