# Stage B Drawings



These drawings should be printed on A3 and pinned up (location to be determined) In the event that it is not possible to display them physically alternative digital arrangements will be provided in good time. A template will be provided in week 4 for these drawings that must be used by all subjects. 

A first task of PM is to coordinate the drawings that are presented. PM should look for opportunities where different systems can be represented on the same drawing.

This defines what strategies you have decided on. Each subject produces 4 drawings. The required drawings are listed below. 

## Architecture 
* Section,  
* 3d view,  
* Ground floor plan,  
* Office plan


this should include 2 options...

# Structure 

* Plan sketch of horizontal stabilising elements. 
* Plan sketch of vertical loaded elements. 
* Sketch of any specific and important special structure. 
* A structural detail dealing with some important connection. 

# MEP 
* Schematics of heating, ventilation, cooling, hot and cold water, drainage 
* Floor section of supply system (mainly ventilation) 
* Location and sizes of technical rooms and shafts
* The main numbers for the LCA summarised.

<!-- This is commented out. 
Geo 

* Soil profile,  
* Footprint, showing also the layout of structural components at foundation level 
* Section N-S, including interactions with structure 
* Section E-W 

Fire 
* Placement of the building showing the access of the fire brigade 
* Describe your evacuation strategy showing the building 
* What part of your building is performance based? What will follow the prescriptive codes? 
-->
# PM / ICT 

* Selected IT tools for simulation/analysis and BIM-modelling, present a process-map, WBS (Work breakdown structure) overview 
* Coordinated schedule of activities for the entire team in the 13-week period 
* Allocated space for building services and structural elements, location of shafts and routing of building services elements. Explain integration of building services as well as structural and architectural elements. 
* Client requirements coordinated with the system engineering process.
