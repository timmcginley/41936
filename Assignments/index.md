This page includes the assignments for each stage and the course grading criteria. These should be read alongside the course [learning objectives](/LearningObjectives).

The course has four stages, A,B,C and D.

## A [Strategise](A.md)

Analyse and reflect on [previous projects] to develop a design concept.

## B [Optioneer](B.md)

Identify and evaluate different design approaches to satisfy your design concept.

## C [Integrate](C.md)

Integrate the building systems of different disciplines to satisfy technical and design requirements for your building.

## D [Detail](D.md)

Detail and communicate your team's final design to a variety of stakeholders in technical reports and a presentation including VR.

# Assessment Rubric

Assesment is divided into 3 equal parts, Integration, Project and Subject (Discipline).

## Integration 
Focus: OpenBIM models 

* Collaborate with diverse members of the design team to realise **interdisciplinary design solutions** based on **systems engineering** principles that balance and integrate their own **disciplinary technical requirements** with those of the team to the satisfaction of the **project requirements**. 
* Actively support alternative interdisciplinary design solution options to support an integrated design process that provides meaningful choices to the client and design team. 
* Make and justify your design decisions based on the project requirements, team needs and reflection on the client, disciplinary expert and peer feedback to improve the design throughout the design process.

## Project 
Focus: Client Report 

* Define, monitor and evaluate their project teamâ€™s values (KPIs) in a professional manner. 
* Strategise, track and update a design management scheme (DMS) to support team coordination and collaboration based on analysis of the project requirements. 
* Develop, maintain and evaluate a digital benchmark building model (BBM) to assess design proposals throughout the project against analysis of the project requirements 
* Evaluate the design models and reports from previous course cohorts to identify the challenges to balancing the project and disciplinary requirements in a complex building project.

## Subject 
Focus: Consultant Report [C](Assignments/C.md#c-consultant-report) and [D](Assignments/D.md#d-consultant-report)

* Model and analyse digital OpenBIM building models using computational design and disciplinary analysis tools to provide realtime guidance to the whole team throughout the design process. 
* Communicate and investigate the building design and analysis using models, drawings, reports, diagrams, dashboards and presentations to internal and or external assessors to a professional level. 
* Guide the building design team with technical subject reports based on disciplinary analysis to provide the scientific foundation for the 'higher level' guidance in the client report.


### Spaces
We assess how well you've organized the spaces according to specifications, including accessibility by foot, bicycle, light rail, taxi, and car. We evaluate access to spaces on each floor and between floors in various scenarios: regular use, maintenance tasks, during events, and in emergencies such as fire. Additionally, we look at how effectively you've integrated different technical disciplines in the basement, shafts, ground floor, and office floors. Your adherence to BIM model requirements, including entities and LOD, is also considered.

## 1/3 Fulfilling Client Requirements (BIM and Client Report):
The teams We evaluate how well you've met the client's requirements and your team's KPIs.

## 1/3 Subject/Technical (Subject Reports):
Your teacher (Chief Consultant) assesses how well you've met the requirements outlined in the subject reports. They make their recommendation to the assessment panel.

# Authorship:

## For BIM: 
Please provide information about the modellers. It's essential to specify if individuals from one subject group or students from other subject groups have assisted.

## For Client and Subject Reports: 
Pages without author(s) will not be considered. This requirement aligns with DTU's regulations. If one subject assists another in tasks and contributes sections to their report, those individuals should be identified as authors. If assistance is provided by someone from a different subject group (e.g., Subject 1 assisting Subject 2), it should be mentioned in Subject 1's report that assistance was given to Subject 2 to ensure proper credit is given.
