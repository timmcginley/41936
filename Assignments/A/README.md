# Part A Assignment

Develop strategies to address technical solutions to address analysed client needs in a 'real' project. 

Stage A starts the course by collaborating on the construction of a physical scale model, that will act as a 'baseline building' for them to improve on. They will then use this to define an 'excel model' for the building.

## Project Plan
**Primary responsible:** PM

PM is primarly responsible for establishing project plan for the entire team.

Each subject group has to identify the parts of the project, the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for themselves and as well as for the team for the 13 and 3 week period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be collectively coordinated by your PM group.

For more details what should be included in a subject plan, please find under [Project Plan](/41936/Deliverables/ProjectPlan).


## Team Contracts 
### PM Responsible

This applies to all subjects, all subjects are involved into comprehending the contracts, its rules, and team decision. Agree on the form of the teams. Submit one signed team contract by every member of the team. The contract is created by the PM group through discussion with the members of the team, and the PM is also responsible to upload it online on DTU Learn. 


## Design Management Scheme 

Identify the parts of the project and the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for the structures group for the 13 and 3 week period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be coordinated by your PM group. 

Identified parts that will help structure the work which will create the schedule, could be static system, material, loads, combinations, element sizes, connections, design calculations, drawings etc.

Design Management Schema

The Design Management Schema (DMS) defines the responsibilities for all project deliverables. This should define what work you need to do. The DMS should describe the actual work which is expected for finishing the outline proposal at the end of the 13 week period. It should include a general scheduled overview of activities.

Subjects responsible to inform PM about the tasks they and others need to do to complete their work.
Subjects responsible to inform PM on the hours they will spend each week on the subject, based on the tasks, to help PM predict the project budget (it includes design costs). Subjects also responsible to document their real hours spent on the project and provide these to PM every week.
PM responsible to coordinate the tasks of the subjects and produce the design management schema.
PM responsible to collate the weekly predicted design cost include this in the design management schema and track and document this throughout the project.

The DMS should also include the signed team contract. The contract applies to all subjects, all subjects are involved into comprehending the contracts, its rules, and team decision. Agree on the form of the teams. Submit one signed team contract per team. The contract is created by the PM group through discussion with the members of the team, and the PM is also responsible to upload it online on DTU Learn.

Benchmark Building

It would be difficult to produce a full shared BIM model at this stage, or would it? we are more interested in the information than the geometry in the early days, if you do not have a 3d model, could you share an excel with all the features and requirements of all the stories in the building and start to think about what they might contain? At this point you will also be defining the F2F for the building.

You should do this, based on the construction of a physical model, produce an 'excel workbook' documenting the basic properties of the initial model. This should also document if this satisfies the analysed client requirements.
