# Assessment Rubric
## Integration 
Focus: OpenBIM models [C](Assignments/C.md#c-bim) and [D](Assignments/D.md#d-bim) and reports

* Collaborate with diverse members of the design team to realise **interdisciplinary design solutions** based on **systems engineering** principles that balance and integrate their own **disciplinary technical requirements** with those of the team to the satisfaction of the **project requirements**. 
* Actively support alternative interdisciplinary design solution options to support an integrated design process that provides meaningful choices to the client and design team. 
* Make and justify your design decisions based on the project requirements, team needs and reflection on the client, disciplinary expert and peer feedback to improve the design throughout the design process.

## Project 
Focus: Client Report [C](Assignments/C.md#c-client-report) and [D](Assignments/D.md#d-client-report)

* Define, monitor and evaluate their project team’s values (KPIs) in a professional manner. 
* Strategise, track and update a design management scheme (DMS) to support team coordination and collaboration based on analysis of the project requirements. 
* Develop, maintain and evaluate a digital benchmark building model (BBM) to assess design proposals throughout the project against analysis of the project requirements 
* Evaluate the design models and reports from previous course cohorts to identify the challenges to balancing the project and disciplinary requirements in a complex building project.

## Subject 
Focus: Consultant Report [C](Assignments/C.md#c-consultant-report) and [D](Assignments/D.md#d-consultant-report)

* Model and analyse digital OpenBIM building models using computational design and disciplinary analysis tools to provide realtime guidance to the whole team throughout the design process. 
* Communicate and investigate the building design and analysis using models, drawings, reports, diagrams, dashboards and presentations to internal and or external assessors to a professional level. 
* Guide the building design team with technical subject reports based on disciplinary analysis to provide the scientific foundation for the 'higher level' guidance in the client report.


### Spaces
We assess how well you've organized the spaces according to specifications, including accessibility by foot, bicycle, light rail, taxi, and car. We evaluate access to spaces on each floor and between floors in various scenarios: regular use, maintenance tasks, during events, and in emergencies such as fire. Additionally, we look at how effectively you've integrated different technical disciplines in the basement, shafts, ground floor, and office floors. Your adherence to BIM model requirements, including entities and LOD, is also considered.



## Grading Rubric
||Basic|Good|Advanced|
|-|-|-|-|
|Points|2|3|4|
|**Integration**|The majority of OpenBIM model, client and consultant report demonstrate design information is coordinated (the same). |All Information across OpenBIM, client and consultant reports is coordinated including different integrated design options. Documented design decisions are integrated and justified |
|**Project**|Track, document and satisfy the team [KPI]s, in the [BBM] including the Beats as required by the project stage. [DMS] Completed. |Compare previous projects to own Team’s KPI and [BBM] performance in the client report based on OpenBIM analysis. |Satisfy team KPIs and produce spaces that are of value to the client with particular emphasis on the quality of space. justify your design decisions, reflect on these.|
|**Subject**|Consultant report demonstrates that all subject requirements are satisfied. |OpenBIM models demonstrate that subject and project requirements are satisfied and client and consultant reports evidence that you have successfully guided the team with disciplinary expertise and that you have changed your design to accommodate the needs of others. |Demonstrated application of subject skill to support other subjects to achieve their goals and the project requirements as well as their own (according to the [DMS]), supported others by changing your design to accomodate the needs of others due to unforseen circumstances, in a way that improves the integration of the project. |
