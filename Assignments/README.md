# Assignments 

The Assignments are designed to guide you through the Advanced Building Design Process.

## A [Strategise](A/README.md)

*Develop strategies to address technical solutions to address analysed client needs in a 'real' project.*

Stage A starts the course by collaborating on the construction of a physical scale model, that will act as a 'baseline building' for them to improve on. They will then use this to define an 'excel model' for the building. This stage also includes the definition of the Design Management Strategy (DMS) all subjects need to contribute to this to help PM to know what they need to do, but PM will coordinate and submit both the baseline building data and the DMS. 

## B [Optioneer](B/README.md)

*Design and analyse different options by defining evaluate different design tactics to satisfy your design strategy in BIM.*

Stage B starts by students 'pinning up' a specified set of drawings defined in their Design Management Schema based on informal feedback they develop design options which modelled, reported and sent to the client for feedback. 

## C [Integrate](C/README.md)

*Collaborate to integrate the building systems of different disciplines to satisfy technical and design requirements.*

Stage C starts by responding to the client feedback and integrating the chosen solution into an 'outline design'. This stage should also update the excel to check the building is on target and justify if not. This will help inform the required subject and client report assignments for stage C. 

## D [Detail](D/README.md)

*Detail and communicate a final design to a variety of stakeholders in technical reports and a presentation including VR.*

Stage D starts by reviewing and providing peer feedback on subject and client reports. They are then given the teacher and peer feedback at the same time. based on this they reflect, model, analyse and document the project in detail (preliminary design). The reports are then used by the reviewers time to ask questions at the  the presentation and VR model demonstration. 

# Grading Criteria

## 1/3 Integration (BIM):
We assess how well you've organized the spaces according to specifications, including accessibility by foot, bicycle, light rail, taxi, and car. We evaluate access to spaces on each floor and between floors in various scenarios: regular use, maintenance tasks, during events, and in emergencies such as fire. Additionally, we look at how effectively you've integrated different technical disciplines in the basement, shafts, ground floor, and office floors. Your adherence to BIM model requirements, including entities and LOD, is also considered.

## 1/3 Fulfilling Client Requirements (BIM and Client Report):
We evaluate how well you've met the client's requirements and your team's KPIs.

## 1/3 Subject/Technical (Subject Reports):
We assess how well you've met the requirements outlined in the subject reports.

# Authorship:

## For BIM: 
Please provide information about the modellers. It's essential to specify if individuals from one subject group or students from other subject groups have assisted.

## For Client and Subject Reports: 
Pages without author(s) will not be considered. This requirement aligns with DTU's regulations. If one subject assists another in tasks and contributes sections to their report, those individuals should be identified as authors. If assistance is provided by someone from a different subject group (e.g., Subject 1 assisting Subject 2), it should be mentioned in Subject 1's report that assistance was given to Subject 2 to ensure proper credit is given.
