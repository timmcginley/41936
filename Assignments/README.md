# Assignments 

This page includes the assignments for each stage and the course grading criteria. These should be read alongside the course [learning objectives](/41936/LearningObejectives).

The course has four stages, A,B,C and D.

## A [Strategise](A/README.md)

*Develop strategies to address technical solutions to address analysed client needs in a 'real' project.*

## B [Optioneer](B/README.md)

*Design and analyse different options by defining evaluate different design tactics to satisfy your design strategy in BIM.*

## C [Integrate](C/README.md)

*Collaborate to integrate the building systems of different disciplines to satisfy technical and design requirements.*

## D [Detail](D/README.md)

*Detail and communicate a final design to a variety of stakeholders in technical reports and a presentation including VR.*

Stage D starts by reviewing and providing peer feedback on subject and client reports. They are then given the teacher and peer feedback at the same time. based on this they reflect, model, analyse and document the project in detail (preliminary design). The reports are then used by the reviewers time to ask questions at the  the presentation and VR model demonstration. 

# Grading Criteria

## 1/3 Integration (BIM):
Focus on the 
### Spaces
We assess how well you've organized the spaces according to specifications, including accessibility by foot, bicycle, light rail, taxi, and car. We evaluate access to spaces on each floor and between floors in various scenarios: regular use, maintenance tasks, during events, and in emergencies such as fire. Additionally, we look at how effectively you've integrated different technical disciplines in the basement, shafts, ground floor, and office floors. Your adherence to BIM model requirements, including entities and LOD, is also considered.

## 1/3 Fulfilling Client Requirements (BIM and Client Report):
The teams We evaluate how well you've met the client's requirements and your team's KPIs.

## 1/3 Subject/Technical (Subject Reports):
Your teacher (Chief Consultant) assesses how well you've met the requirements outlined in the subject reports. They make their recommendation to the assessment panel.

# Authorship:

## For BIM: 
Please provide information about the modellers. It's essential to specify if individuals from one subject group or students from other subject groups have assisted.

## For Client and Subject Reports: 
Pages without author(s) will not be considered. This requirement aligns with DTU's regulations. If one subject assists another in tasks and contributes sections to their report, those individuals should be identified as authors. If assistance is provided by someone from a different subject group (e.g., Subject 1 assisting Subject 2), it should be mentioned in Subject 1's report that assistance was given to Subject 2 to ensure proper credit is given.
