# Assignments 

Please check the Assignments on Learn for more detail. They are summarised here. 

## A Strategise 

Develop strategies to address technical solutions to address analysed client needs in a 'real' project. 

Stage A starts the course by collaborating on the construction of a physical scale model, that will act as a 'baseline building' for them to improve on. They will then use this to define an 'excel model' for the building. This stage also includes the definition of the Design Management Strategy (DMS) all subjects need to contribute to this to help PM to know what they need to do, but PM will coordinate and submit both the baseline building data and the DMS. 

## B Optioneer 

Design and analyse different options by defining evaluate different design tactics to satisfy your design strategy in BIM 

Stage B starts by students 'pinning up' a specified set of drawings defined in their Design Management Schema based on informal feedback they develop design options which modelled, reported and sent to the client for feedback. 

## C Integrate 

Collaborate to integrate the building systems of different disciplines to satisfy technical and design requirements 

Stage C starts by responding to the client feedback and integrating the chosen solution into an 'outline design'. This stage should also update the excel to check the building is on target and justify if not. This will help inform the required subject and client report assignments for stage C. 

## D Detail 

Detail and communicate a final design to a variety of stakeholders in technical reports and a presentation including VR. 

Stage D starts by reviewing and providing peer feedback on subject and client reports. They are then given the teacher and peer feedback at the same time. based on this they reflect, model, analyse and document the project in detail (preliminary design). The reports are then used by the reviewers time to ask questions at the  the presentation and VR model demonstration.
