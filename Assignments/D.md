# Part D

> Detail and communicate a final design to a variety of stakeholders in technical reports and a presentation including VR.

```{attention} Final Presentation location
The final presentation will take place in Building 117, Room 24. You can enter the room from Building 127. 
```

Stage D starts by reviewing and providing peer feedback on subject and client reports. They are then given the teacher and peer feedback at the same time. based on this they reflect, model, analyse and document the project in detail (preliminary design). The reports are then used by the reviewers time to ask questions at the  the presentation and VR model demonstration. 

* Part D Client Report
* Part D Subject Reports
* Part D BIM
* Part D Presentation
* Part D VR Model
* Part D Invoice


## D Report 
This is handed in some days before the final presentation to give the review panel the opportunity to review your proposals and ask deeper questions based on your work.

## D BIM Model
Please ensure your VR model is uploaded to Revizto and your presentation is uploaded to Learn by Tuesday at noon.

### General Rules
* All BIM should be submitted in **both native format (i.e. Revit) and IFC 4X3**
* For IFC be sure to save also save the quantities and make sure that IFCSpaces haev exported correctly.
* Try and incorporate tools from the Advanced BIM class in your processs
* Preference OpenBIM models, standards and processes at all stages of the process
* Validate your IFC files so they conform to the schema with a schema checking tool
* Check your IFC file conforms to the disciplinary needs using the relevant IDS

File naming: xxx_xxx_xxx_xxx

### Architecture
Check IFCSpaces have exported successfully.
Ceilings present and correctly classified

### Structure
The structural system of the entire building including slabs, beams, columns and core. Also conceptual input to basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire core, the elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof, should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines.

## Materials
Are the materials correct?

### PM
Check that the models are aligned, are in the correct place.
Are all models classified in the same system?
Was the IFC export successful
Have the clashes been fixed or if not possible documented in your report?

## Final Presentation
Your presentation should include the following.

### Design Intentions and KPIs
* Explain the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the project.
* Describe the intentions behind your design and how they align with the client’s goals and requirements.
### Response to Feedback
* Summarize the feedback received after the 13-week submission.
* Explain how you have incorporated this feedback into the design to make improvements.
### Navigating the Building
* Describe the approach to the building and the main entrance.
* Explain how people move around within the building.
### Building Layout
* Discuss how the building is divided into different sections.
* Show a few floor plans.
### Structural and Building Services Systems
* Indicate the principles of the structural systems used in the design.
* Describe the building service systems.
### Project Details
* Inform the client about the estimated cost of the project.
* Provide the estimated timeline for construction.
* State the targeted DGNB certification level and explain the sustainability measures taken to achieve it.
