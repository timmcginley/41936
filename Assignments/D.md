# Part D

```{attention}
The final presentation will take place in Building 306, Auditorium 32.
```
**Detail and communicate a final design to a variety of stakeholders in technical reports and a presentation including VR.**

Stage D starts by reviewing and providing peer feedback on subject and client reports. They are then given the teacher and peer feedback at the same time. based on this they reflect, model, analyse and document the project in detail (preliminary design). The reports are then used by the reviewers time to ask questions at the  the presentation and VR model demonstration. 

* D1 Client Report
* D2 Subject Reports
* D3 BIM
* D4 Presentation
* D5 VR Model
* D6 Invoice
<hr>

## D1 Client Report
The final client report should include:

* Project & KPIs
* Team
* Advanced Building Design, what it is to you
* Beats
* Site
* Building Design
* Floors
* Spaces, entrance, auditorium, multipupose and cafe
* Structural system inc. floor plan, loads, components, Geotechnical, Fire Safety
* MEP, Building Systems, Hydronic Systems, basement and tech floor, confort etc.
* Facade
* Reflection
<hr>

## D2 Consultant Reports
These will be submitted some days before the final presentation to give the review panel the opportunity to review your proposals and ask deeper questions based on your work.
<hr>

## D3 BIM
Please ensure your VR model is uploaded to Revizto and your presentation is uploaded to Learn by Tuesday at noon. The BIM should:

* Satisfy all the requirements stated in the [ICT Agreement](/Assignments/A.md#ict-agreement).
* All BIM should be submitted in **both native format (i.e. Revit) and IFC 4X3**
* For IFC be sure to save also save the quantities and make sure that IFCSpaces haev exported correctly.
* Try and incorporate tools from the Advanced BIM class in your processs
* Preference OpenBIM models, standards and processes at all stages of the process
* Validate your IFC files so they conform to the schema with a schema checking tool
* Check your IFC file conforms to the disciplinary needs using the relevant IDS

File naming: xxx_xxx_xxx_xxx

### Structure
The structural system of the entire building including slabs, beams, columns and core. Also conceptual input to basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire core, the elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof, should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines.

## Materials
Are the materials correct?

### PM
Check that the models are aligned, are in the correct place.
Are all models classified in the same system?
Was the IFC export successful
Have the clashes been fixed or if not possible documented in your report?

## Final Presentation
Timings for the presentation:

* 10 min. Presentation    
* 10 min. VR    
* 10 min. Questions
