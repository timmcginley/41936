# Part D Assignments

Detail and communicate a final design to a variety of stakeholders in technical reports and a presentation including VR. 

Stage D starts by reviewing and providing peer feedback on subject and client reports. They are then given the teacher and peer feedback at the same time. based on this they reflect, model, analyse and document the project in detail (preliminary design). The reports are then used by the reviewers time to ask questions at the  the presentation and VR model demonstration. 

## Structure

### D Report 

 
The report on Subject 2 shall be delivered in electronic form as one pdf-file, containing all calculation approaches, brief method descriptions, calculation results and drawing material. The report should be clearly and concisely written in English. The report will be evaluated on the basis of: 

1. Clarity and depth of understanding shown by the description of the chosen design, structural system, response calculation and organization of building function. 

2. Logic, accuracy and completeness of the performed design calculations. 

3. Presentation and analysis of the results. 

The overall and detailed structural design can be documented with: 
* CAD-Drawings and 
* Clear and accurate sketches - electronic or by hand. 

The 3-week report is a continuation of the 13-week report. The 3-week report includes details, more drawings, and more appendices including calculations. You can see it as a detailed design report. 

The 13-week report is more principles and estimates of element dimension, considerations of details. You can see it as a concept design report.
