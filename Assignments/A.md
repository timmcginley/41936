# Part A

> Develop strategies to address technical solutions to address analysed client needs in a 'real' project. 

Stage A starts the course by collaborating on the construction of a physical scale model (A1), that will act as a 'baseline building' for your team to improve on. 
* In parallel the PMs will define the work that the whole team needs to do in the project plan (A2). 
* You will then use the building model to define the benchmark building model (A3).
* This stage also includes the definition of the Design Management Strategy (DMS)(A4) all subjects need to contribute to this to help PM to know what they need to do, but PM will coordinate and submit both the baseline building data and the DMS. 

Includes:
* Physical Building Model (A1)
* Benchmark Building Model (A3)
* Design Management Schema (A4)
* Team Contract (A3)
* Project Plan (A2)



## [A1 Physical Building Model](../Deliverables/PhysicalModel)
For this course we ask you in Stage A to make a model in your teams.

The model should be:

* Scale 1 : 100
* Use the board you have been provided with

For this exercise you should focus on:

* Team building
* Analysing the Project and Client briefs
* Understanding your role, the elements for you to foucs on and the interfaces to others in the design team.
* Learning from the previous projects

For delivery:
* Take pictures of your models and submit them to Learn under Assignments. 
## [A2 Project Plan](../Deliverables/ProjectPlan)
**Primary responsible:** PM

PM is primarly responsible for establishing project plan for the entire team. Each subject group has to identify the parts of the project, the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for themselves and as well as for the team for the 13 and 3 week period and provide these to the PM in a timely manner to be collectively coordinated by your PM group. This should define what work you need to do. The project plan should describe the actual work which is expected for finishing each stage of the Project. It should include: A general scheduled overview of activities 

## [A3 Team Contract](../Deliverables/TeamContract)
This is one of the first coordination tasks for the PM.

### All subjects responsibilities
* The contract applies to all subjects
* All subjects are involved into comprehending the contracts, its rules, and team decision.
* Agree on the form of the teams

### Additional PM responsibilities
* Submit one signed team contract per team.
* The contract is created by the team's PM through discussion with the members of the team
* Upload of the contract online on DTU Learn.
  
## [A4 Design Management Schema](../Deliverables/DesignManagementSchema)
The Design Management Schema (DMS) defines the responsibilities for all project deliverables. This should define what work you need to do. The DMS should describe the actual work which is expected for finishing the outline proposal at the end of the 13 week period. It should include a general scheduled overview of activities.

### Subject Responsibilities
* Inform their PM about the tasks they and others need to do to complete their work.
* Document their real hours spent on the project and invoice these to PM every week.
* Inform PM on the hours they will spend each week on the subject, based on the tasks, to help PM predict the project budget (it includes design costs)

### PM Responsibilities
* Coordinate the tasks of the subjects and produce the design management schema.
* Collate the weekly predicted design cost include this in the design management schema and track and document this throughout the project.

The DMS should also include the signed [team contract](TeamContract.md)? 

## [A5 Benchmark Building Model](../Deliverables/BenchmarkBuildingModel)
Based on an excel sheet template. It will focus on the [Beats](../Project/BEATs) and extend these in some cases.

You should think of this in 2 ways:
1. the most basic BIM you could imagine - no geometry - just the basic information for your design
2. This gives you an idea of a design that you can use as a benchmark / baseline - can you do better? what affect would this building have on your KPIs?

It would be difficult to produce a full shared BIM model at this stage, or would it? we are more interested in the information than the geometry in the early days, if you do not have a 3d model, could you share an excel with all the features and requirements of all the stories in the building and start to think about what they might contain? At this point you will also be defining the F2F for the building.

You should do this, based on the construction of a physical model, produce an 'excel workbook' documenting the basic properties of the initial model. This should also document if this satisfies the analysed client requirements.



<!-- 2025 
This will also include user studies based on current thesis work - they will produce the model but also reports for 4 users . inlcuding fire safety 
or maybe this goes to agile? work it out in the circular repo.
