# Part A

> Develop strategies to address technical solutions to address analysed client needs in a 'real' project. 

Stage A starts the course by collaborating on the construction of a physical scale model, that will act as a 'baseline building' for them to improve on. They will then use this to define an 'excel model' for the building. This stage also includes the definition of the Design Management Strategy (DMS) all subjects need to contribute to this to help PM to know what they need to do, but PM will coordinate and submit both the baseline building data and the DMS. 

Contains:
* [Project Plan](../Deliverables/ProjectPlan)
* [Team Contract](../Deliverables/TeamContract)
* [Design Management Schema](../Deliverables/DesignManagementSchema)
* [Benchmark Building Model](../Deliverables/BenchmarkBuildingModel)
* [Physical Building Model](../Deliverables/PhysicalModel)

This will also include user studies based on current thesis work - they will produce the model but also reports for 4 users . inlcuding fire safety 
or maybe this goes to agile? work it out in the circular repo.
