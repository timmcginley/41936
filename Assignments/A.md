# Part A

> Analyse the existing building and eevelop strategies to address analysed client needs in a 'real' project that could be solved with detailed technical solutions in later stages. 

* Stage A starts the course by students collaborating on the construction of a **physical scale model (A1)**, that will act as a 'baseline building' for your team to improve on. 
* In parallel the PMs will define the work that the whole team needs to do in the **project plan (A2)**. 
* You will then use the building model to fill out an excel sheet that provides the **benchmark building model (A3)**.
* This stage also includes the definition of the **Design Management Plan (DMP) (A4)** all subjects need to contribute to this to help PM to know what they need to do, but PM will coordinate and submit both the baseline building data and the DMP.
* Finally **Part A invoices (A6)** should be submitted:
  
<hr>

## A1 Physical Building Model
Make a model of the existing building document it with photos and then adpat it into a proposed building working in your team. We will provide limited new modelling material and encourage you to reuse the material used in the previous years.

The model should be:

* Scale 1 : 100
* Use the board you have been provided with and the previous material allocated to you.

For this exercise you should focus on:

* Team building
* Analysing the existing building through drawings and BIM and in person visits.
* Analysing the Project and Client briefs
* Understanding your role, the elements for you to focus on and the interfaces to others in the design team.
* Learning from the previous projects
* Satisfy the tests from the list of tests.

### Submission:
Produce a breif report / document including photos of
* Existing building
* Proposed building
* Testing of the model
Provide descriptions fro teh photos compile into a single document and provide to your PM to upload to the DTU learn site with the other required documents for Part A.

### A1 Tests
* The Structure test (wind test)
* The Fire test (Evacuating string test)


<!-- award admonitions - work in Sphyinx -->

```{admonition} Best Model Award
The model that passes all the tests and get the most sticker votes.
```

```{admonition} Early Design Integration Award
The team that demonstrated the best interdisciplinary collaboration in the model building activity.

## A2 Project Plan
**Primary responsible:** PM

PM is primarly responsible for establishing project plan for the entire team. Each subject group has to identify the parts of the project, the associated deadlines and collaborative requirements for themselves as well as for the team across all stages (A, B, C, D) of the project and provide these to the PM in a timely manner for coordination. The project plan should describe the actual work and projected hours that is expected is needed to finish each stage of the Project. This is how you make sure that the work will be done to avoid any delays in payment from the client due to work not being done by the correct stage.

<hr>

## A3 Team Contract
This is one of the first coordination tasks for the PM.

### All subjects responsibilities
* The contract applies to all subjects
* All subjects are involved into comprehending the contracts, its rules, and team decision.
* Agree on the form of the teams

### Additional PM responsibilities
* Submit one signed team contract per team.
* The contract is created by the team's PM through discussion with the members of the team
* Upload of the contract online on DTU Learn.
<hr>  

## A4 Design Management Plan
The Design Management Plan (DMP) defines the responsibilities for all project deliverables. This should define what work you need to do. The DMS should describe the actual work which is expected for finishing the outline proposal at the end of the 13 week period. It should include a scheduled overview of activities. Examples of a plan can be found on older projects, specifically: “CES_BLD_24_06_PM_Appendix” cab be found on Learn.


### Non PM Consultant Responsibilities
* Inform their PM about the tasks they and others need to do to complete their work.
* Document their real hours spent on the project and invoice these to PM every week.
* Inform PM on the hours they will spend each week on the subject, based on the tasks, to help PM predict the project budget (it includes design costs)

### PM Responsibilities
* Coordinate the tasks of the subjects and produce the design management schema.
* Collate the weekly predicted design cost include this in the design management schema and track and document this throughout the project.
<hr>

## A5 ICT Contract
PM to complete an ICT Contract for the team. A template can be found on Learn.
This is a living document that should be updated throughout the project. Particular care should be taken to define:
* LOD for each stage in the project and the responsible consultant.
<hr>

## A6 IDS for consultant BIM (Optional)
Produce an IDS for each consultant to help them check their models. structure the requirements so that they are in project order.
<hr>

## A7 Benchmark Building Model
Based on the construction of a physical model, fill in the supplied excel workbook ('Teams.xlsx' on Microsoft Teams) documenting the basic properties of the both the **existing building **and your **proposed design**. This is one of the first documents that the client will see so try and be as accurate as possible.

### Existing Building
* Floor area (ground and above)
* Building Height
* F2F Height (ground floor)
* F2F office floor
* Total office area
* Total desks

### Proposed Design
* Floor area (ground and above)
* Building Height
* F2F Height (ground floor)
* F2F office floor
* Total office area
* Total desks

You should think of this in 2 ways:
1. the most basic BIM you could imagine - no geometry - just the basic information for your design
2. This gives you an idea of a design that you can use as a benchmark / baseline - can you do better? what affect would this building have on your KPIs?

It would not be possible to produce a full shared BIM model at this stage, we are more interested in the information than the geometry in the early days, if you do not have a 3d model, could you share an excel with all the features and requirements of all the stories in the building and start to think about what they might contain? 
<hr>

## A7 Invoices
* All non PM subjects need to submit invoices to their PM documenting the work they have done for Part A.
* A template invoice can be found on Learn under PM. 
* The PM should then collect the invoices, total hours per consultancy and work tasks done into a single document that they submit with the rest of the documents. 
* The hours are counted per person so if two consultants have worked for 4 hours on the same task, then that's 8 hours to invoice. 

## A8 Client Report
* Provide basic guidance to the client on what you have found from your analysis.
* You should explain to them the implications of different different further analysis that you could do.
* Provide input on how you analysed and plan to proceed with the client requirements.

<!-- 2026
add to client report
The importance of the client analysis needs to be emphasised.,
* input on how to analyse the requirements
* asked to collate and submit these reframed requirements
-->

_For more details and requirements of the assignment from your respective discipline, check the [Subject Requirements](/Subjects/index.md)_

Below is a brief overview of the subject requirements

<!-- 2025 
This will also include user studies based on current thesis work - they will produce the model but also reports for 4 users . inlcuding fire safety 
or maybe this goes to agile? work it out in the circular repo.
