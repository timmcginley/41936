# Part C

Collaborate to integrate the building systems of different disciplines to satisfy technical and design requirements.

Stage C starts by responding to the client feedback and integrating the chosen solution into an 'outline design'. This stage should also update the excel to check the building is on target and justify if not. This will help inform the required subject and client report assignments for stage C. 

* C1 Client Report
* C2 Consultant Reports
* C3 BIM
* C4 Invoice

```{hint}
Part C is your main opportunity to get feedback on your current trajectory and approach before the final 3-week period in Part D, So, make the most of it ðŸ˜Š. Remember to include a list of questions for your chief consultant at the end of your reports to help them focus their feedback for you.
```

## C2 Consultant Reports
Each consultancy delivers a report:

* A4: Maximum 20 pages + appendixes
* A3: Maximum 13 pages + appendixes

Each consultant should review their subject documentation to see which additional requirements are required of them.

* [Structure Report](/Subjects/Structure/index.md#c-consultant-report)
* [MEP Report](/Subjects/MEP/index.md#c-consultant-report)
* [Geotech Report](/Subjects/Geotech/index.md#c-consultant-report)
* [Materials Report](/Subjects/Materials/index.md#c-consultant-report)
* [PM-ICT Report](/Subjects/PM-ICT/index.md#c-consultant-report)

All reports:

* File format: One PDF document per consultancy. No other formats are accepted.
* Note: words count should be the same on A4 and A3 format
* File name: [YEAR]-[TEAM]-[PART]-[SUB].file
* Example for part c consultant report for architecture in team 10: _25-10-C-ARCH.pdf_
* Note_1: Over the limit pages will be ignored
* Note_2: Extra information should be included & referenced to the appendixes chapter at the end of the report, placed after the reference chapter, and will in this way be taken into consideration.
* Note_3: Pages without an author(s) will be ignored.

## C3 BIM 
The building Information models and processes for this project are essential both for the team to progress, analyse and develop the design and future students to learn from the work you have done.

* [Architecture BIM](/Subjects/Architecture/index.md#c-bim)
* [Structure BIM](/Subjects/Structure/index.md#c-bim)
* [MEP BIM](/Subjects/MEP/index.md#c-bim)
* [Geotech BIM](/Subjects/Geotech/index.md#c-bim)
* [Materials BIM](/Subjects/Materials/index.md#c-bim)
* [PM-ICT BIM](/Subjects/PM-ICT/index.md#c-bim)

https://timmcginley.github.io/41936/Assignments/A.html#a5-ict-contract

* Satisfy all the requirements stated in the [ICT Agreement](/Assignments/A.md##a5-ict-contract).
* All BIM should be submitted in **both native format (i.e. Revit) and IFC 4X3**
* For IFC be sure to save also save the quantities and make sure that IFCSpaces have exported correctly.
* Try and incorporate tools from the Advanced BIM class in your processs
* Preference OpenBIM models, standards and processes at all stages of the process
* Validate your IFC files so they conform to the schema with a schema checking tool
* Check your IFC file conforms to the disciplinary needs using the relevant IDS

### Awards
```{admonition} OpenBIM Award - Early Design Guidance
This course produces great BIM, but often it is too late to be useful in the design process - we want to support you to build useful BIM early so that you can use it to better understand the challenges in your building and move towards better integrated designs and making better choices.
```

```{admonition} Computational Design Award
We want you to embrace parametrics and smarter ways to work in this course.
``` 

```{admonition} PM Collaboration Award - Interdisciplinarity
PMs can be nominated by their team based on how well they supported collaboration and interdisciplinarity in the team.
