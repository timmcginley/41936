# Part C

Collaborate to integrate the building systems of different disciplines to satisfy technical and design requirements 

Stage C starts by responding to the client feedback and integrating the chosen solution into an 'outline design'. This stage should also update the excel to check the building is on target and justify if not. This will help inform the required subject and client report assignments for stage C.

## C1 Client Report
The client report is a high level report including information on the:
* Project & KPIs
* Team
* Advanced Building Design, what it is to you
* Beats
* Site

## C2 Consultant Reports
Each consultancy deliver a report:

* A4: Maximum 20 pages + appendixes
* A3: Maximum 13 pages + appendixes

Note: words count should be the same on A4 and A3 format
File format: One PDF document per subject. No other formats are accepted.

Additionally, to the subject specific requirements for this report described for each subject below.

* [Architecture Report](/Subjects/Architecture#consultant-report)
* [Strcuture Report](/Subjects/Architecture#consultant-report)
* [MEP Report](/Subjects/Architecture#consultant-report)
* [Geotech Report](/Subjects/Geotech#consultant-report)

```{note}
Note_1: Over the limit pages will be ignored

Note_2: Extra information should be included & referenced to the appendixes chapter at the end of the report, placed after the reference chapter, and will in this way be taken into consideration.

Note_3: Pages without an author(s) will be ignored.

```{hint}
This is your main opportunity to get feedback on your current trajectory and approach before the final 3-week period in Part D, So, make the most of it ðŸ˜Š Use visuals and diagrams to underline and communicate your design choices and decision making process. Rememeber to include a list of questions for your chief consultant at the end of your reports to help them focus their feedback for you.

## C3 BIM 
The building Information models and processes for this project are essential both for the team to progress, analyse and develop the design and future students to learn from the work you have done.

### Architecture
This model should include all the spaces. 

### Structural -â€¯BIM / 3D models 

You should be developing the BIM model through the course. This might not be possible in the early stages, however, start as soon as possible when some elements are certain. To give you a guide you should expect to have a model that we can do a quantity take off from by week 10. The structural system of the entire building, basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire core should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines. The elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof. 

### OpenBIM award â€“ BuildingSmart Denmark 
It is a course that produces great BIM, but often it is too late to be useful in the design process - we want to support you to build useful BIM early so that you can use it to better understand the challenges in your building and move towards better integrated designs and making better choices. 

### Computational Design Award
We want you to embrace parametrics and smarter ways to work in this course. Therefore in parallel. 

### PM Collaboration Award
PMs nominated by their team based on how well they supported collaboration in the team. 

## Part C Submission
Integrate your recommendations to the client, drawings, separate photos of sketches, and a photo of the all the drawings/sketches on the wall into a client report in PDF. File name: PartB_TeamXX
PM to gather all documents from the team and submit them under Assignment Part B in DTU Learn before the deadline.
