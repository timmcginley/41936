# Part C

Collaborate to integrate the building systems of different disciplines to satisfy technical and design requirements 

Stage C starts by responding to the client feedback and integrating the chosen solution into an 'outline design'. This stage should also update the excel to check the building is on target and justify if not. This will help inform the required subject and client report assignments for stage C. 

* Client Report
* Subject Reports
* Part C BIM
* Part C Invoice

## C Client Report
The client report is a high level report including information on the:
* Project & KPIs
* Team
* Advanced Building Design, what it is to you
* Beats
* Site
* Building Design
* Floors
* Spaces, entrance, auditorium, multipupose and cafe
* Structural system inc. floor plan, loads, components, Geotechnical, Fire Safety
* MEP, Building Systems, Hydronic Systems, basement and tech floor, confort etc.
* Facade
* Questions for feedback


## C Consultant Reports
Each consultancy deliver a report:

* A4: Maximum 20 pages + appendixes
* A3: Maximum 13 pages + appendixes

Note: words count should be the same on A4 and A3 format
File format: One PDF document per subject. No other formats are accepted.

Additionally, to the subject specific requirements for this report described in the subject manual. You must also provide a weekly breakdown of your hours on the project so far.

File name: C_Report_TeamXX_SubY
* Example - C_Report_Team10_Arch
Note_1: Over the limit pages will be ignored
Note_2: Extra information should be included & referenced to the appendixes chapter at the end of the report, placed after the reference chapter, and will in this way be taken into consideration.
Note_3: Pages without an author(s) will be ignored.
  
## Structures
After the PREVIOUS milestone you can now start calculating in more details the forces and dimensions of your structure. Use the methods you are most familiar with. We can give some supervision to FE-modelling but if you have no experience with this method use proper hand-calculations; the Empire State Building was designed long before the computer era! At the end of the 13 weeks you should have a clear idea about your structure, loads and dimensions, detailing and the integration of special architectural features if any. Before you finish the 13-week period your project should be at a point that you have no questions left regarding finalizing the design in the 3 weeks period. You will get comments on the report you have to prepare at the end of the 13 weeks, which should clear up last details. 

Following aspects and issues should be addressed in the report (deliverables): 

* Development of building concept. 
* Choice of static system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates). 
* Choice of material (pure concrete, steel-concrete composite, pure or partial steel structure). 
* Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, fire and overall wind loads). 
* First verification of overall structural stability and foundation pressure. 
* Dimensions of the element profiles and sectional forces on slabs, beams, columns and core.

### Material

The part C subject report for Material should be organised with respect to the topics / elements of the DGNB lite used in the course (LCA documentation is part of the Environmental Theme and should be accounted for there).

Following aspects and issues should be addressed in the report (deliverables): 

* Goals for DGNB certification and discussion on decision process and value of the criteria chosen to reach the intended certification level.
* DGNB lite documentation on all Topics and the chosen Criteria‚Äôs.
* Emphasis should be on value creation of the criteria to the buildings design and end user experience.
* LCA documentation including:
    * Goal and scope
    * Life cycle inventory
    * Visual representation/overview over Life Cycle inventory in reference to the building design
    * Sensitivity analysis
    * Life cycle impact analysis
    * Highlight of hotspots and suggested alternatives / design strategies, to reduce impact.
* Discussion on the Sustainability of your teams building design.
* How can the client and your team argue for the ‚Äúgoodness/value‚Äù of the building for present and future generations (based on your DGNB and LCA work).
* How does the building design show sustainability and sustainable material choices.
* Furthermore, it should clearly explain the different available options, your building design approach and discuss the decision process and trade-offs from a multi-disciplinary standpoint. Examples of how the DGNB lite requirements and LCA analysis has informed your design process are also important.

This should be seen as your main opportunity to get feedback on your current trajectory and approach before the 3-week period. So, make the most of itüòä Use visuals and diagrams to underline and communicate your design choices and decision making process.



## C BIM 
The building Information models and processes for this project are essential both for the team to progress, analyse and develop the design and future students to learn from the work you have done.

### Architecture
This model should include all the spaces. 

### Structural -‚ÄØBIM / 3D models 

You should be developing the BIM model through the course. This might not be possible in the early stages, however, start as soon as possible when some elements are certain. To give you a guide you should expect to have a model that we can do a quantity take off from by week 10. The structural system of the entire building, basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire core should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines. The elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof. 


### OpenBIM award ‚Äì BuildingSmart Denmark 

It is a course that produces great BIM, but often it is too late to be useful in the design process - we want to support you to build useful BIM early so that you can use it to better understand the challenges in your building and move towards better integrated designs and making better choices. 

### Computational Design Award

We want you to embrace parametrics and smarter ways to work in this course. Therefore in parallel. 

### PM Collaboration Award

PMs nominated by their team based on how well they supported collaboration in the team.

Part C subjekt rapport

The 13 week subject report for Material should be organised with respect to the topics / elements of the DGNB lite used in the course (LCA documentation is part of the Environmental Theme and should be accounted for there).

Following aspects and issues should be addressed in the report (deliverables): 

Goals for DGNB certification and discussion on decision process and value of the criteria chosen to reach the intended certification level.

DGNB lite documentation on all Topics and the chosen Criteria‚Äôs.

Emphasis should be on value creation of the criteria to the buildings design and end user experience.

LCA documentation including:

Goal and scope

Life cycle inventory

Visual representation/overview over Life Cycle inventory in reference to the building design

Sensitivity analysis

Life cycle impact analysis

Highlight of hotspots and suggested alternatives / design strategies, to reduce impact.

Discussion on the Sustainability of your teams building design.

How can the client and your team argue for the ‚Äúgoodness/value‚Äù of the building for present and future generations (based on your DGNB and LCA work).

How does the building design show sustainability and sustainable material choices.

Furthermore, it should clearly explain the different available options, your building design approach and discuss the decision process and trade-offs from a multi-disciplinary standpoint. Examples of how the DGNB lite requirements and LCA analysis has informed your design process are also important.

This should be seen as your main opportunity to get feedback on your current trajectory and approach before the 3-week period. So, make the most of itüòä Use visuals and diagrams to underline and communicate your design choices and decision making process.
