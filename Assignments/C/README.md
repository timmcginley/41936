# Part C

## Structures
After the PREVIOUS milestone you can now start calculating in more details the forces and dimensions of your structure. Use the methods you are most familiar with. We can give some supervision to FE-modelling but if you have no experience with this method use proper hand-calculations; the Empire State Building was designed long before the computer era! At the end of the 13 weeks you should have a clear idea about your structure, loads and dimensions, detailing and the integration of special architectural features if any. Before you finish the 13-week period your project should be at a point that you have no questions left regarding finalizing the design in the 3 weeks period. You will get comments on the report you have to prepare at the end of the 13 weeks, which should clear up last details. 

Following aspects and issues should be addressed in the report (deliverables): 

* Development of building concept. 
* Choice of static system (stiffening elements, beam-column system, floor plates). 
* Choice of material (pure concrete, steel-concrete composite, pure or partial steel structure). 
* Loading assumptions (dead loads, traffic loads, fire and overall wind loads). 
* First verification of overall structural stability and foundation pressure. 
* Dimensions of the element profiles and sectional forces on slabs, beams, columns and core. 

### C BIM 
Structural -â€¯BIM / 3D models 

You should be developing the BIM model through the course. This might not be possible in the early stages, however, start as soon as possible when some elements are certain. To give you a guide you should expect to have a model that we can do a quantity take off from by week 10. The structural system of the entire building, basement structure, ramp access to the basement, stairs in the entire core should all be included in the BIM Model and aligned with the other disciplines. The elevator shaft on top of the building, stair access to the building roof.
