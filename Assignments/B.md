# Part B

> Design and analyse different options by defining evaluate different design tactics to satisfy your design strategy in BIM 

Stage B starts by students 'pinning up' a specified set of drawings defined in their Design Management Schema based on informal feedback they develop design options which modelled, reported and sent to the client for feedback.

* B1 Drawings
* B2 Client Report
* B3 Part B Invoice

Documentation of 2 Different design options. 


Define the overall concept for your building through multi-disciplinary drawings that will be 'pinned up'. The drawings will be 'marked up' with feedback by the client/teachers for you to consider.

## B1 Drawings/Sketches

<!-- award admonitions - work in Sphyinx -->

```{important}
**PM coordinates these efforts into integrated drawings**
```

* Please bring your printed drawings with you on Monday, March 17?(TBC). Space to pin up the drawings will be allocated to each team in Building 116. Please make sure to be there by 12:45 in front of the main auditorium (81).

* You will not formally present your drawings. Your subject teachers will, at some point, go with you to the drawings and discuss them. The idea is to create immediate feedback from the teachers.

* You will have to present **two different alternatives** for the floor plan and section. The differences can include the shape of the building, floor height, structural system, type of materials, location of rooms, or shafts, etc.

* We are not providing an 'official template' as some drawings will be sketches, while others will be made on a computer. However, please ensure each of your drawings include the number of your team, The name of the drawing.

* We require that the drawings integrate input from all subjects. This ensures that the project and solutions are coherent and do not clash.

<!--
These drawings should be printed on A3 and pinned up (location to be determined) In the event that it is not possible to display them physically alternative digital arrangements will be provided in good time. A template will be provided in week 4 for these drawings that must be used by all subjects. 

This year we will also ask you to upload your drawings so that we can also show them to other years. Their (SPECKLE) stream was IFC which means it would theoretically be possible to query it and check it here.

Please check out the examples below and you can also have a look at the 3d models in the speckle stream here from 2022 BIM Speckle stream for example 2.

[https://speckle.xyz/streams/0dc122e122]()


The link shows all the branches their speckle stream. See how they have used comments to identify issues they wanted to work on in the model and also included different types of analysis. You do not need to do this but we think it is cool.

The example below are chosen from 2023 so that we are consistent with the projects we show you. The submitted work is not necessarily consistent with the requirements for this year. Please check them.

A first task of PM is to coordinate the drawings that are presented. PM should look for opportunities where different systems can be represented on the same drawing.

### Integrated Drawings

This defines what strategies you have decided on. Each subject produces 4 drawings. The required drawings are listed below. 

These should include:
* Minimum one site plan
* Two alternatives of the ground floor
* Two alternatives of an office floor
* Two alternatives of vertical sections of an office floor
* Two alternatives of the section of the entire building, coloured by functions
* Minimum one 3D view
Any other relevant drawings/sketches

#### Minimum one site plan:
1:200 or appropriate
* Location of the building
* Access for the fire brigades to the building
* Access for waste truck
* Utility systems connected to the building
* Fire egress

#### Two alternative ground floor drawings:
1:100 or appropriate Layout
* Indication of horizontal stabilizing and vertical load-bearing elements
* Location and sizes of potential technical rooms and shafts
* Fire egress

#### Two alternatives office floor drawings:
1:200 or appropriate Layout
* Indication of horizontal stabilizing and vertical load-bearing elements
* Routing (indicative) of heating, cooling, ventilation, hot and cold water, waste water, and sprinkler if needed. Also include electricity/IT/cabling
* Location and sizes of potential technical rooms and shafts
* Fire egress

#### Two alternatives of vertical sections of an office floor:
1:50 or appropriate
* Indicate façades incl. windows, cores, slabs, ceilings, and partitioning walls
* Indication of horizontal stabilizing and vertical load-bearing elements
* Routing (indicative) of heating, cooling, ventilation, hot and cold water, waste water, and sprinkler if needed. Also include electricity/IT/cabling
* Location and sizes of potential technical rooms and shafts
* Fire egress

#### Two vertical section of the entire building including basement:
1:200 or appropriate
* Coloured code functions (office, shaft, lift, fire egress etc.)&nbsp;in the building (by hand is okay)
* Indication of horizontal stabilizing and vertical load-bearing elements
* Routing (indicative) of heating, cooling, ventilation, hot and cold water, waste water, and sprinkler if needed. Also include electricity/IT/cabling
* Location and sizes of main technical rooms and shafts

#### Minimum one 3D view
Isometric or perspective view
* At least one view from the camera position, ideally from a pedestrian point&nbsp;

#### Any other relevant drawings/sketches:
* Sketch of any specific and important subject's point of view
* A structural detail dealing with some important connection
* Schematics of ventilation, heating, cooling, hot and cold water, wastewater, and sprinkler if needed.

### Required subject information 
**These must include the following disciplinary information...**

#### Architecture 
* Section,  
* 3d view,  
* Ground floor plan,  
* Office plan

this should include 2 options...

#### Structure 

* Plan sketch of horizontal stabilising elements. 
* Plan sketch of vertical loaded elements. 
* Sketch of any specific and important special structure. 
* A structural detail dealing with some important connection. 

#### MEP 
* Schematics of heating, ventilation, cooling, hot and cold water, drainage 
* Floor section of supply system (mainly ventilation) 
* Location and sizes of technical rooms and shafts
* The main numbers for the LCA summarised.

#### Geo 
* Soil profile,  
* Footprint, showing also the layout of structural components at foundation level 
* Section N-S, including interactions with structure 
* Section E-W 

#### Fire - [Move to Architecture]
* Placement of the building showing the access of the fire brigade 
* Describe your evacuation strategy showing the building 
* What part of your building is performance based? What will follow the prescriptive codes? 

#### PM / ICT 
* Selected IT tools for simulation/analysis and BIM-modelling, present a process-map, WBS (Work breakdown structure) overview 
* Coordinated schedule of activities for the entire team in the 13-week period 
* Allocated space for building services and structural elements, location of shafts and routing of building services elements. Explain integration of building services as well as structural and architectural elements. 
* Client requirements coordinated with the system engineering process. 

## B2 Client Report 

Contribute towards the client recommendations for your subject, what options would you recommend to the Client? The client report analyzing different options to assist the client in making decisions and providing feedback on the designs in Week 8. The purpose of the report is to document the decisions made by both you and the client (teachers) regarding the initial design of the buildings. We encourage you to develop your own way of presenting this report based on your impression of the client from the communication you have had with them so far. For example, consider whether they would prefer a detailed report with extensive calculations or summaries presented in a 'one-pager'. Would they appreciate an executive summary?

The representation of choices to the client is not predefined in this task; it's up to you, just as it would be in a real project. PM will coordinate these efforts and present recommendations to the client.

## B3 Invoices
* All non PM subjects need to submit invoices to their PM documenting the work they have done for Part A. 
* The PM should then collate the invoices, hours and work done into a single document that they submit with the rest of the documents.
* Should inlcude documented performance against KPIs / Beats to demonstrate on track.

## Submission

Integrate your recommendations to the client, drawings, separate photos of sketches, and a photo of the all the drawings/sketches on the wall into a client report in PDF and upload it to Learn. File name: 9W_TeamXX
