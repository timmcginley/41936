# Part B

> Design and analyse different options by defining evaluate different design tactics to satisfy your design strategy in BIM 

Stage B starts by students 'pinning up' a specified set of drawings defined in their Design Management Schema based on informal feedback they develop design options which modelled, reported and sent to the client for feedback.

At this point in the project you need feedback on 2 different design options so that you can advise the client on your recommended design.

* B1 Drawings (inc. 2 options)
* B2 Client Report (Your team's integrated design recommendations)
* B3 Part B Invoice

Documentation of 2 Different design options. 

Define the overall concept for your building through multi-disciplinary drawings that will be 'pinned up'. The drawings will be 'marked up' with feedback by the client/teachers for you to consider.

## B1 Drawings

```{important}
**PM coordinates these efforts into integrated drawings**
```

* Please bring your printed and correctly scaled drawings with you on Monday, March 17th. Space to pin up the drawings will be allocated to each team in Building 116. Please make sure to be there by 12:45 in front of the main auditorium (81). You will also need to bring pens / pencils so you can annotate and 'mark up' the drawings during the session.


```{note}
We would like to be able to reuse your work (annonymised) in teaching and research to help us design better, more sustainable buldings, by making the work available to future students. You can opt out of this by including an optout.txt saying you do not give you permisssion for the work to be used in future research or teaching along with this submission.
```

* The main function of the drawings session is to get you to decide and present 2 options for each discipline. To support this you will pin up drawings of **two different alternatives** for the floor plan and section. The differences can include the shape of the building, floor height, structural system, type of materials, location of rooms, or shafts, etc.

* The aim is to get feedback from the Chief consultants, external mentors and TAs but also to learn from each others work. At the session you should also look at each others drawings and find ones that are similar to yours. In this way you should be able to establish buddy groups looking at similar issues. Feedback will be oral, so you will need to take notes - this can be done directly on the drawings where appropriate so they provide a record of your next steps. You will use this feedback to inform the decisions about the 

* We are not providing an 'official template' as some drawings will be sketches, while others will be made on a computer. However, please ensure each of your drawings include the number of your team, The name of the drawing.

* We require that the drawings integrate input from all subjects. This ensures that the project and solutions are coherent and do not clash.

A first task of PM is to coordinate the drawings that are presented. PM should look for opportunities where different systems can be represented on the same drawing.

The drawings should include:

#### Minimum one site plan:
1:200 scale
* Location of the building
* Access for the fire brigades to the building
* Placement of the building showing the access of the fire brigade 
* Access for waste truck
* Utility systems connected to the building
* Evacuation strategy showing the building 
* Fire egress

#### 2 x alternative ground floor drawings:
1:100 scale
* Indication of horizontal stabilizing and vertical load-bearing elements
* Location and sizes of potential technical rooms and shafts
* Fire egress
* Location and sizes of shafts in core

#### 2 x alternatives office floor drawings:
1:200 scale
* Indication of horizontal stabilizing and vertical load-bearing elements
* Routing (indicative) of heating, cooling, ventilation, hot and cold water, waste water, and sprinkler if needed. Also include electricity/IT/cabling
* Location and sizes of potential technical rooms and shafts
* Allocated space (in core) for building services and structural elements, location of shafts and routing of building services elements. Explain integration of building services as well as structural and architectural elements. 
* Fire egress

#### 2 x alternatives of vertical sections of an office floor:
1:50 scale
* ARCH: Indicate façades incl. windows, cores, slabs, ceilings, and partitioning walls
* STR: Indication of horizontal stabilizing and vertical load-bearing elements
* Routing (indicative) of heating, cooling, ventilation, hot and cold water, waste water, and sprinkler if needed. Also include electricity/IT/cabling
* Location and sizes of potential technical rooms and shafts
* Fire egress

#### 2 x vertical section of the entire building including basement:
1:200 scale either North South or West East.
* ARCH: Coloured code functions (office, shaft, lift, fire egress etc.) in the building (by hand is okay)
* STR: Indication of horizontal stabilizing and vertical load-bearing elements
* MEP: Routing (indicative) of heating, cooling, ventilation, hot and cold water, waste water, and sprinkler if needed. Also include electricity/IT/cabling
* MEP: Location and sizes of main technical rooms and shafts
* GEO/STR: Footprint, showing also the layout of structural components at foundation level
* GEO/STR: Show interactions between structure and geotechnical.

#### 2 x Basement plan
1:200 scale
* GEO: Footprint, showing also the layout of structural components at foundation level
* MEP: Plant / Technical Space
* ARCH: Bike / stuff storage.
* GEO: Soil profile
* GEO: Showing the different options for Geotech.

#### Minimum one 3D view
Perspective view (A1)
* ARCH: Camera position, ideally from a pedestrian point (none of us actually have helicopters)
* MAT: Show some of the materials of the buidling - but ok to leave out / white where not sure - can you show diff options?

#### Dashboard (printed)
* MAT: The main numbers for the LCA summarised for the differernt options.
* PM: Performance against the Beats (estimated or calculated)
* PM: Performance against the KPIs
* PM: Selected IT tools for simulation/analysis and BIM-modelling, present a process-map, WBS (Work breakdown structure) overview
* PM: Client requirements coordinated with the system engineering process. 

#### Other relevant drawings/sketches:
* STR: Plan sketch of horizontal stabilising elements. 
* STR: Plan sketch of vertical loaded elements.
* STR: Sketch of any specific and important special structure. 
* STR: A structural detail dealing with some important connection
* MEP: Schematics of ventilation, heating, cooling, hot and cold water, wastewater, and sprinkler if not possible to show in main section.
* FIRE: What part of your building is performance based? What will follow the prescriptive codes? 

#### PM / ICT 
* Coordinated schedule of activities for the entire team in the 13-week period

## B2 Client Report 

Based on your reflection of the feedback you recieved, what option combination would you recommend to the client? 
Present your recommendation in this first client report.
The report will analyzing different options to assist the client in making decisions and providing feedback on the designs in Week 8. 
The purpose of the report is to document the decisions made by both you and the client (teachers) regarding the initial design of the buildings. We encourage you to develop your own way of presenting this report based on your impression of the client from the communication you have had with them so far. For example, consider whether they would prefer a detailed report with extensive calculations or summaries presented in a 'one-pager'. Would they appreciate an executive summary?

The representation of choices to the client is not predefined in this task; it's up to you, just as it would be in a real project. PM will coordinate these efforts and present recommendations to the client.

```{info}
Client will select their preferred options based on the guidance that you provide.
```

## B3 Invoices
* All non PM subjects need to submit invoices to their PM documenting the work they have done for Part A. 
* The PM should then collate the invoices, hours and work done into a single document that they submit with the rest of the documents.
* Should inlcude documented performance against KPIs / Beats to demonstrate on track.
<hr>

## Part B Submission
Integrate your recommendations to the client, drawings, separate photos of sketches, and a photo of the all the drawings/sketches on the wall into a client report in PDF. File name: PartB_TeamXX
PM to gather all documents from the team and submit them under Assignment Part B in DTU Learn before the deadline. 

Enter your BEATS in MS Teams:
