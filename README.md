# Advanced Building Design

Advanced Building Design provides collaborative analysis based design experience for Architectural Engineering and Civil Engineering MSc students in their third semester. At this point in the programme they have are becoming engineers in a specific discipline and have many competences to offer the multi disciplinary team. This course focusses on supporting them to apply those competences in a collaborative context. The course focuses on developing *disciplinary empathy*.

The course runs over the spring 13 week period and the June 3 week period. It relies on 4 subject experts and a digital collaborative design framework to give participants experience of integrated building design, and how specialised competences can be used in collaboration within multidisciplinary project teams to create a design fulfilling many functional requirements at the same time. In this course, you are working with the additional competences it takes to construct solutions to open ended problems compared with only being able to analyse a given construction. The course is based on solving in a complex and realistic design problems in groups which is in line with the demands given by the construction industry.

## Course Features
* Industry design, engineering and collaboration mentors
* Deep disciplinary sparring with subject expert teachers
* Collaboration experience with peers to produce a 'real' design with 4 different subjects.
* OpenBIM Technologies to support the OpenBIM Transition in the AEC
* Benchmark your performance against pervious years to help you design 'better' buildings.
* VR Design Reviews
* Industry supported Building Prototyping Workshops
* Track your progress against 4 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
* Selected Projects get to present their work in Mentor's office.

# Course overview 

## Part
This course has around 100 students each year with different disciplinary backgrounds. The students choose a subject and then submit a tender to become part of a team. There are 1-2 students per subject (group) and 7 subject groups per building team. 

> ‘knowledge is constructed through the activities of the learner’ ​(Biggs, 2014)​ 

This course supports the construction of your knowledge and skills in the collaborative design and development of a high rise building through activities that are aligned to support you to achieve the course learning objectives. Motivating activities have been carefully developed over the last 14 year period to inspire you in this course. 

This course is designed to give the greatest opportunity to arrive at a design that is integrated between the subjects, whilst addressing the client requirements. However, this also requires a lot of work from you. The course expectations have been clearly articulated to support you to synthesise the feedback you will receive during the course. In this way we hope to support your learning and ultimately construct your knowledge and expertise in advanced building design! 

We use the following concepts in the advancced building design process.

* [KPIs](KPIs/README.md)
* [DGNB](/Tools/DGNB/README.md) Alignment
* [BEATS](BEATS/README.md)

Furthermore, we are continuing with the beats - the idea with the beats is that they can provide you and members of your team and peers with a quick numeric overview of your project. This will also help us to track the projects and flag those that mind need help.
