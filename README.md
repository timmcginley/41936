# Advanced Building Design
Advanced Building Design provides collaborative analysis based design experience for Architectural Engineering and Civil Engineering MSc students in their third semester. At this point in the programme they have are becoming engineers in a specific discipline and have many competences to offer the multi disciplinary team. This course focusses on supporting them to apply those competences in a collaborative context. 

The course runs over the spring 13 week period and the June 3 week period. It relies on 7 subject experts and a digital collaborative design framework to give participants experience of integrated building design, and how specialised competences can be used in collaboration within multidisciplinary project teams to create a design fulfilling many functional requirements at the same time. In this course, you are working with the additional competences it takes to construct solutions to open ended problems compared with only being able to analyse a given construction. The course is based on solving in a complex and realistic design problems in groups which is in line with the demands given by the construction industry.
