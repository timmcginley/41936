# Advanced Building Design
> Designing better, more sustainable buildings requires interdisciplinary analysis and improvement *throughout* the design process.

Advanced Building Design has been runnning at DTU for 15 years, it offers participants a collaborative, analysis based, professional design experience. However we do not simply wish to replicate real world design processes, we use the course to develop new ways of working that will help you to provide solutions the challenges your will face in your career. Ultimately, through its integration into the [circular education system] our aim is to learn how to design the best buildings in the world.

## Course Features
* Collaboration experience with peers to produce a 'real' design in one of 6 possible roles.
* Play the role of running of a design/engineering consultancy; do the work and keep the lights on.
* Receive input from leading industry design, engineering and collaboration mentors.
* Engage in deep disciplinary sparring and feedback with subject expert teachers (chief consultants)
* Apply OpenBIM Technologies to support the OpenBIM Transition in the AEC.
* Benchmark your performance against previous years to help you design 'better' buildings.
* Track your design progress with project [BEATS](/Project/BEATS) and 4 [KPIs](/Project/KPIs)s (Key Performance Indicators)
* Gain experience working with [DGNB 2025](/Tools/DGNB/README.md) (simplified version)
* Selected Projects get to present their work in Mentor's office.

## When
The course runs over the spring 13 week period and the June 3 week period. 

## Who is it for?
The course is designed to give interdisciplinary design and analysis experience to MSc Architectural Engineering and Civil Engineering students at the Technical University of Denmark. However other relevant disciplines are welcome to apply, please see the available [roles] for a better idea.

## How does it work
In 2025 the course has 175 students with different disciplinary backgrounds. Participants choose a subject (with guidance) and then submit a tender to become part of a team. There are 1-2 students per subject (group) and 7 subject groups per building team. 

## What is the Building?
Traditionally we have focused on new tall office buildings but in 2025 we will change to focus on the options of renovating buildings on DTU Campus that comply with DTU Campus plan and the municipalities plan. Check this year's [project](/Project) for more information.
