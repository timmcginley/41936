# Advanced Building Design
> Designing better, more sustainable buildings requires interdisciplinary analysis and improvement *throughout* the design process.

Advanced Building Design offers participants a collaborative, analysis based, professional design experience. The course provides an opportunity for us all to learn how to design better more sustainable builidngs. Through its integration into the [circular education system] our aim is to use the course to learn how to design the best buildings in the world.

## Course Features
* Collaboration experience with peers to produce a 'real' design as consultant in one of 6 possible roles.
* Simulate the running of your own consultancy.
* Input from leading industry design, engineering and collaboration mentors.
* Deep disciplinary sparring with subject expert teachers.
* OpenBIM Technologies to support the OpenBIM Transition in the AEC.
* Benchmark your performance against pervious years to help you design 'better' buildings.
* Industrial and academic feedback.
* Track your design progress with project [BEATS](/Project/BEATS) and 4 [KPIs](/Project/KPIs)s (Key Performance Indicators)
* Aligned to [DGNB 2025](/Tools/DGNB/README.md) (simplified version)
* Selected Projects get to present their work in Mentor's office.

## When

## Who is it for?
The course is designed to give interdisciplinary design and analysis experience to MSc Architectural Engineering and Civil Engineering students at the Technical University of Denmark.

# Course overview 
The course runs over the spring 13 week period and the June 3 week period. 

## Part
This course has around 175 students each year with different disciplinary backgrounds. The students choose a subject and then submit a tender to become part of a team. There are 1-2 students per subject (group) and 7 subject groups per building team. 

> ‘knowledge is constructed through the activities of the learner’ ​(Biggs, 2014)​ 

This course supports the construction of your knowledge and skills in the collaborative design and development of a high rise building through activities that are aligned to support you to achieve the course learning objectives. Motivating activities have been carefully developed over the last 14 year period to inspire you in this course. 

This course is designed to give the greatest opportunity to arrive at a design that is integrated between the subjects, whilst addressing the client requirements. However, this also requires a lot of work from you. The course expectations have been clearly articulated to support you to synthesise the feedback you will receive during the course. In this way we hope to support your learning and ultimately construct your knowledge and expertise in advanced building design! 

We use the following concepts in the advancced building design process.

* [DGNB](/Tools/DGNB/README.md) Alignment
* [BEATS](BEATS/README.md)

Furthermore, we are continuing with the beats - the idea with the beats is that they can provide you and members of your team and peers with a quick numeric overview of your project. This will also help us to track the projects and flag those that mind need help.
